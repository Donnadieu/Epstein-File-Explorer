    "The U.S. Attorney's Office is seeking a voluntary interview and written answers from an unnamed UK-based client on topics relevant to the Ghislaine Maxwell investigation, including events outside the 1994-1997 indictment period.",
    "The client's UK attorneys (Blackfords LLP) have only offered a written witness statement limited to the indictment period and subject to strict confidentiality, refusing a live interview because the U.S. views their client as a 'subject' not a 'witness'.",
    "The correspondence reveals a significant point of contention: the U.S. prosecutors interpret the client's limited offer as a refusal to cooperate fully on the broader investigation.",
    "The defense attorneys cite UK legal practices and precedents (like Kastigar v. United States) to argue for protections against the use of any provided information, indicating concerns about self-incrimination.",
    "The client is confirmed to have had an association with both Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, and possesses knowledge relevant to the criminal prosecution."
