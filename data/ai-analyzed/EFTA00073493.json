  "summary": "This is a published opinion from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the case of In re Wild, concerning a petition for a writ of mandamus. The petitioner, Courtney Wild, an alleged victim of Jeffrey Epstein, argued that federal prosecutors violated her rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) by failing to confer with her before entering into a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) with Epstein in 2007. The Eleventh Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Newsom, held that CVRA rights do not attach until criminal proceedings have been initiated (by complaint, information, or indictment). Since no federal charges were ever filed against Epstein in the Southern District of Florida, the court found the CVRA was never triggered and denied the petition. Judge Tjoflat concurred, and Judge Hull dissented.",

    "The district court had previously found in 2019 that the government violated the CVRA by not conferring with victims about the NPA, but dismissed the case after Epstein's death, denying all requested remedies."
