    "128,175 email attachments were empty files, likely due to the FBI's inability to fully extract data from Epstein's email platform.",
    "Search terms included names of victims, co-conspirators (like Ghislaine Maxwell), and keywords like 'flight' and 'passenger'; 'jeevacation' (Epstein's email pattern) generated 750,000 hits.",
    "Emails discussed logistics such as travel, meetings with women, payments for school, property renovations, and Epstein's finances, often involving a person referred to by the last name 'Muffley'.",
    "Prosecutors referenced a prior case ('GEP' - likely referring to the Jeffrey Epstein case) where similar issues with empty attachments occurred and were marked as non-responsive."
