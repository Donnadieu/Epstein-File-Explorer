    "Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team is preparing a renewed motion for release on bail with new information and sureties not available at the initial hearing.",
    "The defense wants to file portions of the bail motion under seal to protect sureties' identities, Maxwell's financial details (2015-2020), and confidential discovery materials.",
    "The letter cites specific social media threats against Maxwell, including violent posts calling for her death, as justification for keeping sureties' identities confidential.",
    "The government consents to sealing certain information but does not consent to holding an in-camera conference as requested by the defense.",
    "The defense references a similar case (United States v. Nejad/Sadr) where Judge Carter ordered redaction of bail materials containing sensitive private information."
