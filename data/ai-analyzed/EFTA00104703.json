    "The court denied Ghislaine Maxwell's request to subpoena the entire teenage diary of 'Minor Victim-2,' finding the request was an overbroad 'fishing expedition' aimed at improper impeachment.",
    "The Government and the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP both represented that the victim's diary does not mention Ghislaine Maxwell and that the victim stopped writing in it shortly after meeting Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "Maxwell's request for a pair of black boots allegedly given to a victim by her and Epstein was denied as moot because the Government committed to making them available for defense inspection before trial.",
    "Maxwell's request for original versions of certain photographs was partially denied; for photos in FBI possession, the request was moot, and for others, the court found no relevance beyond impeachment.",
    "The court consistently ruled that potential impeachment of a witness is not a proper ground for issuing a Rule 17(c) subpoena, as such materials only become relevant after testimony."
