    "The Epstein Victims' Compensation Program is a voluntary, independent program designed to resolve claims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein, administered independently from his estate.",
    "The program is open to all victims regardless of when or where the abuse occurred, whether the claim is time-barred by statutes of limitations, or if they have previously settled with Epstein.",
    "Jordana H. Feldman serves as the Program Administrator with final, binding authority to determine claimant eligibility and compensation amounts, with no aggregate cap on available funds.",
    "Claimants who accept compensation must sign a release dismissing all claims against Epstein's estate and related entities/individuals, but the release does not prevent them from speaking to law enforcement.",
    "The program includes provisions to prevent fraudulent claims, with false submissions potentially being forwarded to law enforcement for investigation."
