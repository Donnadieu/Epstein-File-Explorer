  "summary": "This is the U.S. Government's omnibus opposition memorandum to Ghislaine Maxwell's twelve pre-trial motions in her criminal case (S1 20 Cr. 330). It argues against motions to dismiss based on Jeffrey Epstein's Non-Prosecution Agreement, statute of limitations, pre-indictment delay, suppression of evidence, perjury charges, severance, sufficiency of the indictment, and various disclosure requests. The document details the legal and factual basis for the charges and the government's investigation.",

    "The government argues Jeffrey Epstein's 2007 Non-Prosecution Agreement with the Southern District of Florida is irrelevant: it does not bind the SDNY, does not name or immunize Maxwell, and covers different crimes and time periods than those charged.",
    "The indictment is timely under 18 U.S.C. § 3283, which provides an extended statute of limitations (through the life of the victim) for crimes 'involving the sexual or physical abuse of a child'; the 2003 amendment applies retroactively to conduct not yet time-barred.",
    "The government obtained materials from Maxwell's civil depositions via a grand jury subpoena to Boies Schiller after Chief Judge McMahon modified the protective order; the government denies misleading the court or colluding with the law firm.",
    "Maxwell's perjury counts (Five and Six) are based on allegedly false statements during her April and July 2016 depositions in the Giuffre v. Maxwell defamation case; the government contends the questions were not fundamentally ambiguous and the falsity and materiality are for the jury to decide.",
    "The use of a grand jury sitting in White Plains was proper, especially during the pandemic when it was the only available grand jury; the defendant's fair cross-section challenge fails as the jury pool was drawn from a properly designated geographic area and shows minimal absolute disparity for Black and Hispanic populations."
