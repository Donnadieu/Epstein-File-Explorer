    "The defense argues it cannot prepare a fair defense without knowing the identities of the three alleged victims (Victims 1-3) referenced in the indictment, as the alleged misconduct occurred roughly 25 years ago in multiple locations.",
    "The government refused to disclose victim identities, stating it would only do so through Rule 16 discovery or Jencks Act material closer to trial, despite the court's protective order being in place.",
    "Ghislaine Maxwell's conditions of confinement at the MDC are described as uniquely onerous, including 24-hour surveillance, extended solitary confinement beyond COVID-19 quarantine, and severely limited access to discovery materials.",
    "The defense claims Maxwell's harsh treatment is a reaction to the circumstances surrounding Jeffrey Epstein's pretrial detention and death in August 2019.",
    "The defense requests Maxwell be released to the general population and be granted significantly increased computer access to review voluminous discovery, estimating that at the current proposed rate of 3 hours per day, reviewing just the first 13,000-page production would take until mid-November 2020."
