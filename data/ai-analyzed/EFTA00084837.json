    "The government had produced over 165,000 pages of discovery to Ghislaine Maxwell's defense within two weeks of the protective order being docketed.",
    "The government strongly opposed disclosing the names of victim-witnesses 11 months before trial, citing legal precedent and a desire to protect victim privacy.",
    "The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) planned to provide Maxwell extended access to discovery materials from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. daily, subject to operational constraints.",
    "The government expressed concern that Maxwell's defense counsel had referenced receiving sealed discovery materials from the criminal case in a public civil court filing.",
    "The defense's request for court intervention in Maxwell's detention conditions was deemed premature, as BOP was conducting an individualized assessment for her housing and security."
