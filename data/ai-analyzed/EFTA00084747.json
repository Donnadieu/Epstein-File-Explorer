    "A new federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein was active as of December 2018, led by the referenced office (likely SDNY) and the FBI, concerning allegations of sexual abuse of dozens of minors over more than a decade.",
    "The investigation specifically involved minors who were transported to and from New York for the purpose of sexual abuse.",
    "The 2008 Florida Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) was noted as binding only the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, implying it may not bar prosecution in other jurisdictions like New York.",
    "The Florida NPA purportedly immunized not just Epstein but also alleged co-conspirators, including a New York-based 'booker' responsible for scheduling 'massages' with underage girls.",
    "Investigators were reviewing documents from the original Florida investigation and beginning to identify victims based in New York, with plans to look into post-NPA misconduct allegations."
