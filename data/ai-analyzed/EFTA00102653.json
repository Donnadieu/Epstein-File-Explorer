  "summary": "This is an email chain between U.S. Attorney's Office (SDNY) personnel discussing scheduling and the outcome of an oral argument in a FOIA case related to Jeffrey Epstein. The argument was before Judge Engelmayer, who expressed skepticism about the breadth of the government's withholdings under FOIA Exemption 7(A) and will order in camera review. The court also directed communication with Audrey (likely a supervisor) about reconsidering the FOIA response in light of the new administration.",
