  "summary": "This document is a series of forwarded emails from SEC whistleblower Christopher J. Dilorio, dated between June and October 2020, alleging widespread corruption and criminal obstruction by the SEC and SDNY. Dilorio claims the agencies protect financial entities like Jefferies, Virtu Financial (NITE), and others involved in abusive naked short selling, money laundering via OTC markets, and accounting fraud, while suppressing his whistleblower claims and denying him awards. He specifically references the Dan Kamensky case and implicates numerous financial and political figures.",
