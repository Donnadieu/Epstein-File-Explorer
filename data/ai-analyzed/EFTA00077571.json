    "The defense alleges that a prosecutor (AUSA) made materially false statements to Chief Judge McMahon in an April 2019 ex parte proceeding, denying any prior contacts between the U.S. Attorney's Office and the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP before November 2018.",
    "Contrary to the prosecutor's statements, there was a meeting on February 29, 2016, where Boies Schiller attorneys (Peter Skinner, Stan Pottinger, Brad Edwards) met with AUSA to present allegations and advocate for a criminal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.",
