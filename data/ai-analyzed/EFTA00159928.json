  "summary": "This is a peer-reviewed psychological science article titled 'Long-Term Memory in Adults Exposed to Childhood Violence: Remembering Genital Contact Nearly 20 Years Later'. It presents a longitudinal study examining the accuracy of adults' memories for documented childhood genital contact experienced during a forensic medical examination. The study finds that almost half of the adults remembered the contact, with child sexual abuse history and greater depression predicting greater memory accuracy. This document is a research article titled 'Remembering Genital Touch' from the journal 'Applied Cognitive Psychology'. It presents a study examining adults' long-term memory (after nearly 20 years) for documented genital contact experienced during a childhood medical examination. The study analyzes factors like age, gender, depression, and child sexual abuse history as predictors of memory accuracy. This document is a section of an academic research article titled 'Remembering Genital Touch' published in a psychology journal. It reports on a longitudinal study examining adults' memories of a forensic anogenital medical examination they experienced as children approximately 20 years earlier. The study analyzes factors like child sexual abuse history, gender, psychopathology, and prior interviews on long-term memory accuracy and suggestibility for abuse-related events. This document is a reference list from an academic article, likely a literature review or research paper, focusing on the psychology of memory, trauma, and child sexual abuse. It contains no direct information about the Epstein case, individuals involved, or specific events related to it.",

    "The study found that 43% of adults correctly reported documented genital touch from a childhood medical exam after nearly 20 years, while 50% said 'don't know' and 7% incorrectly denied it.",
    "A history of child sexual abuse (CSA) was a significant predictor of accurately reporting the childhood genital contact in adulthood, even after controlling for other factors like frequency of discussion.",

    "A significant proportion of adults accurately recalled documented genital touch from a forensic medical exam experienced approximately 20 years earlier in childhood.",
    "Adults with a history of child sexual abuse were more likely to accurately report the genital touch, regardless of gender.",
    "No participant falsely reported highly inappropriate, legally chargeable acts (e.g., being hit or kissed by the doctor/nurse) that had been suggested in childhood interviews, even after 20 years.",
