The complaint seeks damages and outlines the structure of the 'Epstein Enterprise.' This document is a portion of the First Amended Complaint filed by the Government of the Virgin Islands (GVI) against the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein. It details the use of Epstein's private islands (Little St. James and Great St. James) as secluded locations for sex trafficking and abuse, the creation of corporate entities to conceal assets and activities, fraudulent acquisition of tax benefits, and ongoing efforts to obstruct law enforcement and environmental inspections.
