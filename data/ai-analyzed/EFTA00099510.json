  "summary": "This is a legal memorandum filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team in support of a motion to dismiss the superseding indictment. The defense argues the indictment was obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment because the grand jury was drawn from the White Plains Division, which allegedly systematically underrepresented Black and Hispanic residents compared to the Manhattan Division where the alleged crimes occurred. The filing references procedural history and expert analysis on jury composition.",
