    "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) was actively drafting an affidavit for a search warrant for Jeffrey Epstein's private island, Little St. James, in early August 2019.",
    "Logistical planning involved multiple agencies including the FBI, Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), with concerns about transportation, lodging, and operating in intense heat.",
    "A previous search of Epstein's New York City residence, though initially limited, expanded to a full 13-hour search yielding 845 photographs, setting a precedent for the planned island search.",
    "The document indicates an effort by SDNY to isolate the 2019 case from the previous investigation into Epstein that occurred approximately 12 years prior.",
    "The planning emails reveal the operation was considered substantial and required careful coordination to execute the warrant and seize evidence, including digital evidence, as quickly as possible."
