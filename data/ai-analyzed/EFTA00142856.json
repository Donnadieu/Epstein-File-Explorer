  "summary": "This is an internal email dated August 14, 2019, listing 11 staff members on AWOL (Absent Without Leave) status for the week of August 4-10, 2019, primarily due to issues with OWCP (Office of Workers' Compensation Programs) cases ending, lack of LWOP (Leave Without Pay) approval, or medical reasons. It also mentions an attached augmentation agreement but no agreement on overtime sign-up procedures. The document appears to be routine administrative HR correspondence and does not directly reference Epstein, his associates, victims, or criminal activities.",
