    "Ghislaine Maxwell was held under specialized detention conditions at the MDC Brooklyn, including 24/7 surveillance, frequent searches, and a dedicated three-guard security detail.",

    "A significant point of contention was Maxwell's access to a government-provided laptop for reviewing discovery; the court ultimately ordered the BOP to grant her access on weekends and holidays.",
    "The court denied the defense's request to have Warden Heriberto Tellez appear personally, instead relying on written submissions from MDC legal counsel.",
    "The government stated Maxwell had 'more time to review her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC' and more attorney communication time than other inmates."
