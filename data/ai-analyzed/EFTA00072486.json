    "Ghislaine Maxwell was placed in a 14-day quarantine in November 2020 after potential COVID-19 exposure, during which she maintained access to legal materials and communication.",
    "The defense argued Maxwell was subject to uniquely restrictive conditions including excessive searches (weekly body scans, 15-minute flashlight checks, open-mouth inspections) and constant surveillance by a three-guard detail and cameras.",
    "A central point of contention was the defense's request for Warden Heriberto Tellez to appear personally before the court, which Judge Nathan ultimately denied.",
    "Judge Nathan ordered the government to submit written status updates on Maxwell's confinement conditions every 60 days, focusing on access to legal materials and attorney communication.",
    "The court granted and later upheld an order requiring the BOP to give Maxwell access to a government-provided discovery laptop on weekends and holidays, over the BOP's objections.",
    "Ghislaine Maxwell was permitted to review discovery materials for 13 hours per day, seven days a week, which was more time than any other inmate at the MDC.",
    "The discovery in the case totaled more than two million pages, and Maxwell had access to both a BOP desktop computer and a government-provided laptop for review.",
    "Maxwell's conditions included regular pat-down searches, weekly body scans, and nighttime wellness checks every 15 minutes where staff confirmed she was breathing.",
    "The government reported that Maxwell was physically healthy, her weight fluctuated between the 130s and 140s, and she had received the COVID-19 vaccine and was fully vaccinated.",
    "The MDC investigated and found unfounded a complaint from defense counsel about an inappropriately conducted pat-down search, confirming it was recorded and conducted appropriately."
