  "summary": "This is a memorandum and order by Judge Loretta A. Preska denying Ghislaine Maxwell's request for reconsideration of the court's July 23, 2020 decision to unseal her deposition transcript and that of 'Doe 1' in the civil case brought by Virginia Giuffre. The court rejects Maxwell's argument that her recent indictment and arrest constitute new grounds for keeping the depositions sealed, noting the issues were already considered, and imposes a brief stay to allow Maxwell to appeal.",

    "Judge Loretta A. Preska denied Ghislaine Maxwell's last-minute request to reconsider the unsealing of her deposition and that of 'Doe 1'.",
    "Maxwell argued her July 2020 indictment and arrest constituted a new development warranting secrecy, but the court ruled this concern was already implicit in her prior arguments and had been considered.",
    "The court imposed a short stay until July 31, 2020, to allow Maxwell to seek an emergency stay from the Court of Appeals, with unsealing scheduled for August 3, 2020.",
    "The document references ongoing criminal investigations into individuals associated with Jeffrey Epstein, explicitly including Maxwell.",
    "The ruling reinforces the presumption of public access to court records, finding Maxwell's arguments insufficient to overcome it."
