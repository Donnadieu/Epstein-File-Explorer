    "Prince Andrew's lawyers offered that he would provide a written witness statement and answer written questions relevant to the Ghislaine Maxwell indictment, but resisted a voluntary in-person or video interview with U.S. prosecutors.",

    "Prince Andrew's legal team sought to limit questioning to the period of the Maxwell indictment (1994-1997) and demanded strict confidentiality, preventing sharing with complainants or in civil matters.",
    "The correspondence reveals a negotiation deadlock, with U.S. prosecutors interpreting the offer of written answers only as a refusal to participate in an interview or answer questions about events outside 1994-1997."
