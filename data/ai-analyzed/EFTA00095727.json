    "The OPR investigation concluded that the prosecutors, including Alexander Acosta, did not commit professional misconduct in negotiating the 2007 Non-Prosecution Agreement with Jeffrey Epstein, but that Acosta exercised 'poor judgment.'",
    "The NPA required Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, serve 18 months in jail (he served less than 13), register as a sex offender, and provide a mechanism for victim restitution, in exchange for the federal government ending its investigation and agreeing not to prosecute Epstein or named co-conspirators.",
    "Victims were not informed of or consulted about the NPA before it was signed, and letters sent to victims afterward described the case as 'under investigation,' which a federal court later found misled them.",
    "The report details Epstein's efforts after the NPA was signed to invalidate it by appealing to senior DOJ officials, arguing the matter was a 'quintessentially state matter,' but the Deputy Attorney General declined to intervene in June 2008.",
    "The OPR investigation was initiated following a December 2018 request from Senator Ben Sasse after the Miami Herald's November 2018 investigative report."
