  "summary": "This is a reply memorandum filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team in support of her motion to sever Counts 5 and 6 (perjury) from Counts 1-4 (Mann Act violations) in her superseding indictment. The defense argues the counts are improperly joined, dissimilar, temporally disconnected, and that a joint trial would introduce highly prejudicial and inadmissible evidence related to a 2016 defamation lawsuit.",

    "The defense argues the perjury counts (from 2016 depositions) are improperly joined with Mann Act counts (from 1994-1997) as they are temporally separated by 20 years and concern different subject matter (a defamation case vs. sex trafficking).",
    "The perjury counts stem from Maxwell's deposition in the defamation case Giuffre v. Maxwell, where she was questioned about allegations made by Virginia Giuffre (referred to indirectly as 'Accuser-4' or similar).",
    "The defense claims trying the counts together would force the jury to hear extensive, prejudicial evidence about the defamation case, CVRA litigation, and allegations of abuse by other victims not named in the indictment.",
    "Maxwell's long-time defense counsel also represented her in the civil defamation case, creating a potential conflict under the 'advocate-witness rule' if they had to testify about the deposition while also acting as her criminal trial lawyers.",
    "The defense accuses the government of adding the perjury counts to call Maxwell a liar in front of the jury and to introduce 'extremely prejudicial evidence of alleged sexual abuse through the back door.'"
