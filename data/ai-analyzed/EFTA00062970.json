    "The witness, a BOP Senior Officer Specialist, was working as Control One on August 9 (4pm-midnight) and Internal Two on August 10 (midnight-8am) during the period of Epstein's death.",
    "Significant discrepancies existed in inmate counts for the SHU on August 9-10, 2019. Inmate Fernandez was moved to R&D dry cell at 3:15 p.m. on August 9 but was not keyed out of the SHU until 12:35 a.m. on August 10, causing the SHU to report 73 inmates instead of 72 for multiple counts.",
    "The witness acknowledged writing \"9S+1\" on an R&D count slip and potentially a \"+1\" on a SHU count slip, indicating a 'ghost count' likely authorized by an Operations Lieutenant, but could not recall specific conversations or timing.",
    "The witness responded to the body alarm for Epstein at ~6:33 a.m. on August 10, assisted in getting a stretcher, and followed the ambulance to the hospital. He stated Epstein was already receiving CPR when he arrived.",
    "The witness cited systemic issues at the MCC, primarily a critical lack of staff, high turnover, and mandatory overtime, as contributing factors to operational failures."
