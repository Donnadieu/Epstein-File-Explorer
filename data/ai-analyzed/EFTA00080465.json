The order grants most of the government's and defendant's redaction requests to protect third-party privacy and ongoing investigations but denies some requests for being insufficiently justified or not narrowly tailored.",

  "keyFacts": [
    "The court applies the Lugosch test to balance the common law/First Amendment presumption of access to judicial documents against countervailing interests like privacy and law enforcement integrity.",
    "Redactions are largely granted to protect third-party names, contact information, and private family affairs, with the court emphasizing these privacy interests 'should weigh heavily'.",
    "The court denies the government's redaction requests for pages 1-128 and 187-188 of its brief, and for sealing Exhibits 8 and 9, finding the requests not narrowly tailored and lacking non-conclusory justification.",
    "The government is given until March 22, 2021, to file a letter justifying more tailored redaction requests for the denied portions or to indicate it will not renew the request.",
    "The order references sealed proceedings before different judges relating to the issuance of grand jury subpoenas in connection with the Maxwell case."
