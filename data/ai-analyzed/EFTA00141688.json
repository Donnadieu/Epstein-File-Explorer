  "summary": "This DOJ OIG memorandum details the analysis of surveillance video footage from the MCC New York Special Housing Unit (SHU) on August 9-10, 2019, surrounding the death of inmate Jeffrey Epstein. It documents the limited camera coverage, identifies staff on duty, and reconstructs a timeline of events, revealing that correctional officers failed to conduct required inmate counts and rounds. This document is a detailed timeline analysis of surveillance camera footage from the Special Housing Unit (SHU) at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) on August 9-10, 2019. It meticulously tracks the movements of correctional officers (COs) and inmates, including Jeffrey Epstein, in the hours leading up to his death. The report cross-references footage with officer statements and official logs.",
