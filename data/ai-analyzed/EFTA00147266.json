  "summary": "Internal FBI email chain from August 20, 2019, discussing the handling and processing of hard drives seized in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. The emails reveal that drives were initially missed during a search, later recovered from a third-party residence, and were undergoing a 'taint process' due to potential privileged information. High-level FBI officials (DD, ADIC, CID, AG) are inquiring about prioritizing the exploitation of this media to identify co-conspirators.",
