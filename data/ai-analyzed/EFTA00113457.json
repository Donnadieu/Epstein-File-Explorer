    "The document contains a forensic claim that a neck groove on Jeffrey Epstein's body proves he was dead for 2-6 hours when found.",
    "The analysis argues the groove does not match a sheet noose, is too narrow (like an electric cord), and is low on the neck, which is more consistent with a garroting than a hanging.",
    "The email, sent by Mark Epstein to attorney Stacey Richman, directly challenges the official narrative that Epstein died by suicide in his prison cell."
