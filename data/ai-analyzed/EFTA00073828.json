    "The government obtained financial records showing Epstein made two large, suspicious payments in late 2018: $100,000 and $250,000 to individuals named as potential co-conspirators and featured in the Miami Herald series.",
    "During a July 2019 search, law enforcement found an expired foreign passport in Epstein's safe bearing his photo but a different name, suggesting the capability to obtain false travel documents.",
    "The same safe contained over $70,000 in cash and 48 loose diamonds, which the government argues shows the capability to flee the jurisdiction.",
    "The identities of the two payment recipients are redacted in the public filing, as they are potential co-conspirators/witnesses.",
    "The government is arguing for Epstein's pre-trial detention based on this evidence of flight risk and potential witness tampering."
