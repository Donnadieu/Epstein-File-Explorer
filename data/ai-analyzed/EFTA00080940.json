    "Victims of Jeffrey Epstein were seeking formal 'victim notification letters' from the FBI to use in applying for a victim compensation fund.",
    "The FBI initially declined to provide FD-302 interview reports (standard interview forms) due to the active investigation.",
    "Law enforcement officials acknowledged a legal complication: not all individuals they interviewed in the Epstein case were necessarily victims of a federal crime, which is what a standard notification letter would state.",
    "The correspondence shows internal deliberation within the NYPD/FBI Child Exploitation Human Trafficking Task Force about how to appropriately assist all individuals negatively affected by Epstein while adhering to legal protocols."
