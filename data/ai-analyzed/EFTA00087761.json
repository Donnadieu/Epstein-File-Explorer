  "summary": "This is a letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York to Judge Alison J. Nathan, outlining the government's plan to obtain and review investigative files from the prior Florida investigation into Jeffrey Epstein (2005-2010) for potential disclosure in the Ghislaine Maxwell case. It details the legal framework for disclosure obligations and lists six specific sources of Florida investigation materials the government intends to review. This is a government court filing from October 7, 2020, addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan. It details the prosecution's planned approach to gathering and reviewing materials from prior investigations (specifically the USAO-SDFL Florida investigation and USAO-SDGA's involvement in CVRA civil litigation) for potential disclosure obligations (Giglio/3500 material) in the Ghislaine Maxwell prosecution. The government asserts these other offices are not part of the current prosecution team but outlines extensive review efforts.",

    "The prosecution team (SDNY USAO, FBI NY, NYPD) had no involvement in the prior Florida Investigation into Epstein, which concluded about eight years before the Maxwell investigation began.",

    "The government maintains that none of the other offices or agencies (USAO-SDFL, USAO-SDGA) are part of the 'Prosecution Team' for the current Maxwell case, as they did not participate in witness interviews, strategy, charging decisions, or grand jury presentations."
