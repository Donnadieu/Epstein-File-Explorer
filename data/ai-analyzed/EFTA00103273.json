  "summary": "This is a court opinion and order by Judge Alison J. Nathan resolving Ghislaine Maxwell's pretrial motions in her criminal case. The court denies most motions, including those to dismiss based on Epstein's non-prosecution agreement and statute of limitations, but grants severance of the perjury charges for a separate trial. The opinion details the legal reasoning regarding the scope of Epstein's 2007 NPA and the timeliness of the charges. This is a court opinion and order (Document 207) from the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell, filed on April 16, 2021. It addresses several defense motions to dismiss the indictment, focusing on the statute of limitations, pre-indictment delay, specificity of charges, and the legal tenability of perjury counts. The court denies the motions, finding the prosecution timely and the charges sufficiently specific. This is a court opinion and order (Document 207) from Judge Alison J. Nathan in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell. The court denies most of Maxwell's pretrial motions but grants her motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial. It also addresses motions related to discovery, surplusage, multiplicity, and grand jury challenges, setting deadlines for the parties to negotiate a pretrial schedule.",

    "The court ruled that Jeffrey Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement does not bar the prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell in the Southern District of New York, as it only binds the Florida district and does not cover the offenses charged (from 1994-1997).",
    "The court denied Maxwell's motion to dismiss based on statute of limitations, holding that the PROTECT Act's life-of-the-victim limitations period applies to the Mann Act charges as they involve the sexual abuse of minors.",
    "The court granted Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts, ordering they be tried separately.",
    "The opinion references a Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility report that found the Epstein NPA was unusual in its breadth, leniency, and secrecy, and reflected 'poor judgment.'",
    "The court concluded the Mann Act charges (1994-1997) fall outside the temporal scope of Epstein's NPA, which covered conduct from 2001-2007.",
    "The court ruled that the statute of limitations (18 U.S.C. § 3283, as amended by the 2003 PROTECT Act) applies to Maxwell's alleged offenses, allowing prosecution during the life of the victim, even for conduct predating the Act's enactment.",
    "The court rejected Maxwell's due process claim based on pre-indictment delay, finding she failed to show the government intentionally delayed for an improper purpose or that the delay caused serious prejudice to her defense.",
    "The court found the indictment, including Mann Act counts, was sufficiently specific despite using 'on or about' dates and not naming victims, as it tracked the statutory language and provided approximate times and places.",
    "The court upheld the legal tenability of the perjury charges stemming from Maxwell's civil deposition, finding the questions were not fundamentally ambiguous and issues of materiality and falsity were for the jury to decide.",
    "The opinion cites the deaths of Jeffrey Epstein, his mother, a police detective, and another individual as potential witnesses, but the court found Maxwell's claims of prejudice from their absence to be speculative and insufficient to dismiss the indictment.",
    "The court granted Ghislaine Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts, ordering them to be tried separately to ensure a fair trial and protect her right to counsel.",
    "The court denied Maxwell's motion to dismiss the indictment based on Jeffrey Epstein's non-prosecution agreement, finding it did not bind the government regarding Maxwell.",
    "The court found the perjury charges legally tenable, as truthful answers in her civil deposition could have led to discovering other victims or witnesses.",
    "The court denied as premature Maxwell's motions to strike surplusage from the indictment and to dismiss allegedly multiplicitous charges.",
    "The court ordered the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all outstanding pretrial disclosures, including Brady/Giglio material and witness lists, aiming for production 6-8 weeks before trial."
