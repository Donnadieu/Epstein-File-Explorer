  "keyFacts": [
    "Mock jurors were highly skeptical of claims that Ghislaine Maxwell was genuinely interested in mentoring young people, noting the lack of formal structure and the exclusive selection of girls.",
    "Jurors found a specific quote attributed to Maxwell—telling a victim 'thank you for being here so I don't have to'—to be compelling evidence that she knew about the harms occurring.",
    "The observation revealed jurors were largely averse to victim-shaming and did not find victims' prior lies about prostitution or delayed reporting to significantly undermine their credibility.",
    "Knowledge that Maxwell received $25 million was seen by jurors as strengthening the government's case regarding her motive, while its absence would cast doubt.",
    "Jurors expressed concern that Maxwell might have been a 'secondary target' if they learned Epstein was investigated in 2006 and she was not charged until after his death."
