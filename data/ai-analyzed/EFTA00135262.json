    "Corrections Officers Noel and Thomas admitted to the supervising Lieutenant that they failed to perform the mandatory 3:00am and 5:00am inmate count rounds on the night Jeffrey Epstein died.",
    "Epstein did not have a cellmate ('bunkie') at the time of his death, which violated MCC's 'basic 101' policy requiring inmates on suicide watch or psychological observation to have one.",
    "The Lieutenant who discovered the scene saw a noose fabricated from bed sheets but could not recall if it was around Epstein's neck or on the ground.",
    "Neither Officer Noel nor Officer Thomas wrote a required memo about the incident, and neither had returned to work since Epstein's death.",
    "MCC policy requires logs of all inmate movements to be passed between shifts; the absence of a log entry about Epstein's cellmate being removed suggests a procedural failure."
