The interview is part of an OIG investigation into the events surrounding the death of inmate Jeffrey Epstein. The witness provides background on his BOP career and discusses the departure of his supervisor, the MCC New York Facility Manager. This document is a transcript of an interview or deposition with a former Bureau of Prisons employee (referred to as MR. [REDACTED]) regarding his role and responsibilities at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in 2018-2019.

This document is a deposition transcript discussing a contract for camera system upgrades at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) New York. The conversation focuses on a contract with SigNet Technologies, delivery of equipment, installation responsibilities, and discrepancies about whether the camera equipment was ever delivered to the facility.

    "The interview is part of the official DOJ OIG investigation into the events surrounding the death of inmate Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "The witness is a former BOP Maintenance Mechanic Supervisor (General Foreman) who worked at MCC New York from December 2016 until February 14, 2019.",
    "The witness's direct supervisor, the Facility Manager, left MCC under mysterious circumstances after a training trip to Denver, cutting off all communication and never returning.",
    "The witness had to informally absorb some facility manager duties after his supervisor's departure, with approval from higher-ups, but was never formally designated or paid as acting.",
    "The OIG agents place the witness under oath and have him sign both a Warnings and Assurances form and a Non-Disclosure Agreement regarding the interview documents.",
    "The interviewee's official title was General Foreman, but he performed duties of the Facilities Manager after his supervisor left, though he was never formally promoted or designated as 'acting' in a way he considered official.",
    "A significant camera system upgrade project was initiated at the MCC to address long-standing issues with broken cameras, outdated analog recorders, and blind spots. The project was budget-constrained, requiring a reduction from over $1 million to around $800,000.",
    "At the time of the interviewee's departure in February 2019, no new cameras or associated wiring from this upgrade project had been installed in the institution.",
    "There were persistent, pre-existing problems with cameras in the Special Housing Unit (SHU), including cameras being damaged by inmates and a general lack of functionality, which hampered internal investigations.",
    "The document reveals organizational confusion and informal chains of command within the MCC's Facilities Department, with roles and responsibilities being 'sporadic' and subject to oversight and override by executive staff.",
    "A contract worth $698,108 was awarded to SigNet Technologies on September 21, 2018, to upgrade the camera system at MCC New York, with an initial proposal over $1 million.",
    "The deponent, a facilities official, claims no camera equipment from the SigNet contract was delivered or present at MCC New York during their tenure, which ended February 14, 2019.",
    "Conflicting accounts exist: SigNet's Justin Houston claimed gear was delivered ~30 days post-contract, and acting Facilities Manager Nobile claimed it was on-site when he arrived in early 2019.",
    "Installation was delayed because, according to a BOP email, necessary fiber cable had not been delivered, preventing the camera system from being installed.",
    "The contract's listed delivery date of September 28, 2018, was deemed unrealistic by the deponent, who believed the contractor (SigNet) was supposed to bring all equipment for installation, not have it shipped separately.",
    "The interview reveals significant confusion among investigators about the location of camera system equipment for MCC New York, with the interviewee stating the equipment was not on-site but stored at a separate warehouse facility (Building 4) in the Brooklyn Navy Shipyard.",
    "The interviewee describes unusual security practices at MCC New York, where communication technicians had camera monitoring equipment in their office rather than under strict SIS (Special Investigative Services) control as was standard at other institutions.",
    "The document indicates the camera system project involved multiple layers of bureaucracy and oversight issues, with the interviewee noting 'too many hands in the pot' including two wardens, two associate wardens, two comm techs, and two facility managers.",
    "The interview was conducted by Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General agents investigating the camera system installation, suggesting this was part of an official inquiry into prison operations or procurement."
