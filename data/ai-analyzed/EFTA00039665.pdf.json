  "summary": "This document is a series of emails from whistleblower Christopher J. Dilorio to various judges and SEC officials, primarily dated May 21, 2021, with earlier threads from 2020. Dilorio alleges massive, ongoing securities fraud involving naked short selling, money laundering, and SEC obstruction. He specifically implicates Knight Capital/KCG/Virtu (NITE), UBS, Jefferies, and others in a scheme involving OTC market shells, and accuses the SEC of using his whistleblower information to both bring and obstruct complaints while denying him compensation.",
