  "summary": "This document is a series of emails from whistleblower Christopher J. Dilorio to various judges and SEC officials, primarily dated May 21, 2021, with earlier threads from 2020. Dilorio alleges massive, ongoing securities fraud involving naked short selling, money laundering, and SEC obstruction. He specifically implicates Knight Capital/KCG/Virtu Financial (NITE), UBS, Jefferies, and others in a criminal enterprise facilitated by corrupt SEC officials. The emails serve as a formal appeal against the SEC's denial of his whistleblower award claim for the Oppenheimer AML action (2015-016).",

    "Dilorio claims the SEC has criminally obstructed investigations into his allegations since 2011, actively facilitating the ongoing fraud by bailing out Knight after the 2012 'glitch' and allowing the fraudulent Virtu-KCG merger to proceed in 2017.",
    "Key figures implicated in the alleged scheme and cover-up include Jefferies CEO Rich Handler, Virtu CEO Douglas Cifu, former SEC Chair Jay Clayton, his former Sullivan Cromwell colleague Jared Fishman, and SEC IG Carl Hoecker.",
    "Dilorio provides specific evidence, citing a 2013 CGFIA 10-Q filing that mentions a 'Global Lock' due to actions by a 'third-party broker-dealer' as irrefutable proof of naked shorting, which the SEC allegedly ignored.",
    "The emails frame the SEC's denial of Dilorio's whistleblower award for the Oppenheimer AML action as part of the obstruction, using a 'fabricated' reason that investigators never saw his information, despite the OWB's explicit responsibility to distribute such tips."
