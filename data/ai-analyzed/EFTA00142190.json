The interview is part of an OIG investigation into the death of inmate Jeffrey Epstein and surrounding circumstances, focusing on follow-up questions regarding the movement of Epstein's cellmate, Efrain Reyes, on August 9, 2019. This document is a transcript of an interview conducted by Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General agents with a correctional officer (referred to as MR. [REDACTED]) regarding events at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) on August 9, 2019. The interview focuses on the transfer of inmate Efrain Reyes (Jeffrey Epstein's cellmate) and the failure to assign Epstein a new cellmate, as well as a separate incident involving inmate Fernandez.

    "The interview is part of an official DOJ OIG investigation into the death of Jeffrey Epstein and related circumstances, focusing on job performance and security failures.",
    "The witness, a BOP lieutenant, confirms that inmate Efrain Reyes (Epstein's cellmate) was 'pre-removed' from the MCC at 8:35 AM on August 9, 2019, a procedure meaning he left the building and was likely not returning.",
    "The interview clarifies that 'pre-remove' and 'WAB' (with all belongings) are essentially the same procedure for moving an inmate out of the facility.",
    "The document reveals the OIG's investigative focus on inmate movement logs and procedures at the MCC around the time of Epstein's death.",
    "The interview investigates a critical procedural failure: why Jeffrey Epstein was not assigned a new cellmate after his cellmate, Efrain Reyes, was transferred on August 9, 2019.",
    "The officer (MR. [REDACTED]) admits he knew Reyes was listed as 'WAB' (With All Belongings), which typically means an inmate is leaving, but claims there was still a possibility Reyes could return within hours.",
    "The officer claims he notified other officers ([REDACTED] and [REDACTED]) that Epstein needed a new cellmate, but those officers, when interviewed, denied being told.",
    "A separate incident involving inmate Fernandez on the same day reveals potential communication and procedural breakdowns in notifying control when an inmate is moved, paralleling issues in the Epstein/Reyes situation.",
    "The document highlights a culture of assumed responsibility, where staff believed someone else would handle key tasks like notifying control or assigning a new cellmate, leading to failures."
