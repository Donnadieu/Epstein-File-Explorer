    "The defense requested and arranged for review of evidence (hard drives and boots) to be relocated to the FBI field office in Colorado for easier access.",
    "Significant technical problems plagued the discovery process, with thousands of images unreadable due to corrupt files, missing metadata, and incompatible file formats.",
    "The protective order defined 'Highly Confidential' material broadly to include any nude, partially-nude, or sexualized images, not limited to child pornography, restricting defense access to government-controlled review only."
