    "Epstein agreed to plead guilty to a state charge requiring sex offender registration (solicitation of minors for prostitution) and serve an 18-month county jail sentence followed by 12 months of community control.",
    "The agreement required Epstein to provide compensation to victims identified by the U.S., through an attorney representative selected with his counsel's approval, whom he would pay.",
    "The federal grand jury investigation was to be suspended and subpoenas held in abeyance unless Epstein violated the agreement."
