  "summary": "This is a 2021 opinion and order by Judge Alison J. Nathan denying Ghislaine Maxwell's motion to suppress evidence obtained via a grand jury subpoena to the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (BSF). Maxwell argued the subpoena violated her Fifth and Fourth Amendment rights and due process because the documents were under a protective order from prior civil litigation. The court rejects all arguments, finding no constitutional violation and no basis for suppression or an evidentiary hearing.",

    "The government obtained Maxwell's civil deposition transcripts via a grand jury subpoena to her opponent's law firm, Boies Schiller Flexner, after a judge modified a protective order.",
    "Maxwell argued this violated her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, but the court ruled a civil protective order provides no guarantee against use in a later criminal case and she could have invoked the Fifth in the civil deposition.",
    "The court also found no Fourth Amendment violation because Maxwell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in documents shared with numerous third parties under the protective order.",
    "Maxwell alleged the government misled Judge McMahon by not disclosing a 2016 meeting with BSF attorneys, but the court found no due process violation and insufficient showing for an evidentiary hearing under the Franks standard.",
    "Much of the material obtained, including Maxwell's deposition transcripts, has since been unsealed and made public by court order in the civil case."
