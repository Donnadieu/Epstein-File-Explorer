    "A non-prosecution agreement between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida was negotiated in September 2007, amended twice, and prevented federal charges for sex crimes against the victims.",
    "The victims and their attorneys were not informed about the non-prosecution agreement until after June 30, 2008, due to a confidentiality provision complied with by the U.S. Attorney's Office and FBI.",
    "The U.S. Attorney's Office had changed its position and was not attempting to work out undisputed facts, focusing instead on the lack of filed federal charges and Epstein's state guilty plea.",
    "Attorney Brad Edwards requested the full non-prosecution agreement, FBI interview reports of his clients, and assistance in securing a transcript of the victims' petition hearing."
