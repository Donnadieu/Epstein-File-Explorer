  "keyFacts": [
    "Defense attorney Roy Black was seeking to resolve the Epstein case before July 7, 2008, and inquired if federal prosecutors would 'go away' if Epstein accepted State Attorney Barry Krischer's 60-day plea deal.",
    "Federal prosecutors stated their position was conditional: if Epstein 'stops the process in Washington' and abides by a signed agreement, they would perform pursuant to that agreement.",
    "Federal prosecutors explicitly stated that if Epstein pleads to a different charge or receives a lower sentence at the state level, they would consider it a breach of their agreement and would 'proceed accordingly'.",
    "The email references a prior 'signed agreement' between federal prosecutors and Epstein, the terms of which are not fully detailed but are central to the negotiations.",
    "The author, an Assistant U.S. Attorney, indicates that all substantive communication regarding the case is being handled by them and another person, not Rolando."
