  "dateOriginal": "2019-08-12 to 2019-08-15",
  "summary": "This document set contains the FBI's initial electronic communication opening a death investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's suicide, FD-302 interview reports with BOP personnel regarding the incident and prison protocols, and multiple evidence logs detailing the seizure of surveillance system hard drives from the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC). It details the discovery of Epstein's body, initial findings of protocol failures, and the evidence collection process. This document is an FBI 302 interview report of a Unit Manager at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) regarding the supervision and events surrounding Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration and death. The interviewee details Epstein's behavior, housing assignments, suicide attempt in July 2019, the process of assigning him a cellmate, and the circumstances on the night of his death, including a phone call Epstein made. The report also includes a chain of custody log for evidence collected from Epstein's cell. This document is a daily assignment roster for correctional staff at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York, covering August 9-10, 2019. It details post assignments, shift changes, and staff statuses (sick leave, annual leave, etc.), and includes the names of specific inmates in Special Housing Units (SHU). This document contains administrative records from the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) New York for August 10, 2019, including staff schedules, inmate counts, and Special Housing Unit (SHU) 30-minute check sheets for Tiers G through M. It also includes a series of FBI Collected Item Logs documenting the submission of cloned hard drives (evidence items 1B4 through 1B18) for forensic analysis on August 16, 2019, and the seizure of evidence from MCC cell #220 and New York Presbyterian Hospital on August 10, 2019, related to the death investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. This document set contains FBI investigative records from the death investigation of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in August 2019. It includes interviews with inmates who witnessed the events, logs of seized video evidence, and database checks on correctional officers of interest. The records detail the discovery of Epstein's death, inmate observations of guard behavior, and the collection of digital evidence from the MCC. This is a background check report on Tova Noel, generated on August 18, 2019. It compiles personal identifiers, addresses, utility services, a criminal traffic citation, a divorce case record, and lists of associates. The report appears to be part of an investigative data collection, possibly related to the Epstein case, though no direct connection to Epstein is stated in this excerpt. This document contains law enforcement database query results for Tova A. Noel, including DMV records, criminal history checks, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection travel history. The search appears to be part of an investigation (Case No. 90A-NY-3151227) into violent crime and gangs, and reveals Noel's applications for law enforcement-related jobs and her international travel patterns. This document is a collection of investigative reports and database queries from August 2019, primarily focusing on two individuals: Tova Anjanique Noel (a person of interest) and Michael A. Thomas Sr. It includes a 'Person of Interest Worksheet' for Noel detailing her background, travel, and job applications, and extensive background checks on Thomas, including his criminal history, vehicle registrations, and associates. The searches were conducted by FBI personnel in relation to case number 90A-NY-3151227. This document is a comprehensive background or financial report on an individual named Michael Thomas, generated on August 18, 2019. It compiles data from credit bureaus, utility records, civil judgments, lawsuits, vehicle registrations, and relative associations, detailing his addresses, financial debts, and legal history. The report appears to be part of an investigative or due diligence process, possibly related to the Epstein case, to profile associates or individuals of interest. This document appears to be a detailed individual report, likely a financial or background check report, on a person named Michael Thomas (or Michael A. Thomas). It lists numerous addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and possible aliases associated with this individual across multiple states and years, suggesting an investigation into his identity, locations, and potential associates. This document is a financial or investigative report listing numerous individuals named 'Michael Thomas' or 'Michael A Thomas' with associated Social Security Numbers, dates of birth, and extensive address histories spanning multiple decades and military locations. It appears to be a data aggregation report linking multiple individuals with the same name to various addresses, possibly for investigative purposes. This document appears to be a financial or background investigation report on an individual named Michael Thomas, generated on August 19, 2019. It compiles extensive address history, potential associates, and public record searches including court cases and a bankruptcy filing. The report includes analytics flags for criminal records, sanctions, and other checks, most returning negative results. This document is an FBI database check report and Person of Interest worksheet, dated August 22, 2019. It contains background checks on two individuals: Michael Albert Thomas and Robert Charles (last name partially redacted). The checks were performed as part of investigations into Jeffrey Epstein's death and a drug introduction at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. The report includes passport info, criminal history, DMV records, vehicle registrations, and associates for the subjects. This is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) TECS query report generated on August 20, 2019, showing the travel encounter history for an individual named Latham. The report lists four cruise ship arrivals between 2011 and 2013, with secondary inspection details for one entry in December 2013. The document is part of law enforcement records related to the Epstein case. This document is a compilation of FBI investigative records related to the death investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. It includes a proffer interview with Omar Deleon, the collection and forensic examination of an iPhone from Michael Thomas, detailed logs of DVR hard drives seized from the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), and an interview with an MCC Lieutenant regarding the circumstances of Epstein's death and prison procedures.",
