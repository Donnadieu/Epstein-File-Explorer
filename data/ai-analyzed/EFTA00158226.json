  "summary": "This document is a series of letters and faxes between defense attorney Michael Salnick and Assistant U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta regarding Janusz Banasiak, a witness in a grand jury investigation. Salnick seeks formal immunity for Banasiak, while Acosta asserts Banasiak is not a target and offers a limited use immunity agreement (Kastigar letter) for an interview. The correspondence reveals negotiations over the terms of Banasiak's cooperation and Acosta's inquiry into potential conflicts of interest in Salnick's representation.",
