  "summary": "This document is an email chain between Assistant U.S. Attorneys and Ghislaine Maxwell's defense attorneys, primarily Laura Menninger, regarding the logistics of reviewing physical evidence and highly confidential materials (including nude/partially nude images) seized from Jeffrey Epstein's residences. The correspondence details negotiations over where evidence will be reviewed (500 Pearl Street courthouse vs. FBI Bronx warehouse), what can be photographed, and the schedule for Maxwell's participation. It reveals the existence of thousands of previously undisclosed 'highly confidential' images and the government's evidence handling procedures.",
