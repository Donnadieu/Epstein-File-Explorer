    "The court denied Ghislaine Maxwell's request for a broad exception to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who had spoken publicly about her or Jeffrey Epstein, limiting such references only to those who have publicly identified themselves in this specific litigation.",
    "The court found the Government demonstrated good cause to protect the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses, even if they had made past public statements, as participating in a criminal prosecution is distinct from making general public statements.",
    "The court rejected Maxwell's unprecedented request to restrict potential Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for the criminal trial, noting existing legal restrictions on the Government are sufficient.",
    "The protective order allows the defense to reference identities of individuals they believe may be relevant to potential defense witnesses and their counsel during investigation and trial preparation."
