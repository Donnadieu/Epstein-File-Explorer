    "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (USAO-SDNY) planned to indict Jeffrey Epstein on July 2, 2019, for sex trafficking of a minor and conspiracy.",

    "The document states that three specific victims, who also recruited other girls for Epstein, have described the pattern of abuse.",
    "The USAO-SDNY argues that a prior non-prosecution agreement (NPA) from the Southern District of Florida does not bind their office and does not cover the New York-based victims central to their case.",
    "The legal strategy involves using a revised statute of limitations law from April 2003 and charging conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 371, as the specific sex trafficking conspiracy statute (18 U.S.C. § 1594) was enacted after the alleged conduct."
