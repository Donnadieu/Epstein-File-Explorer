    "The USAO-SDNY planned to indict Jeffrey Epstein on July 2, 2019, for sex trafficking of a minor and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of a minor.",
    "The charges stem from Epstein's alleged sexual abuse of dozens of minor girls in New York and Florida from at least 2002 to 2005, using a scheme where victims were recruited for 'massages' that escalated into sex acts for cash.",
    "The draft report explicitly states that the Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) from the Southern District of Florida does not bind the SDNY and only covered certain listed Florida victims, and the SDNY's charges do not include Florida-based victims.",
    "The investigation by the USAO-SDNY began in approximately December 2018.",
    "Three specific victims in New York and Florida are referenced, each of whom also allegedly recruited other girls for Epstein in exchange for payment."
