    "The U.S. Attorney's Office states that the client of attorney Jill Greenfield is not a target of the Epstein investigation and they have no reason to believe she committed a federal crime.",
    "The prosecutor's office believes, based on other witnesses and records, that the 'overwhelming majority of young women and girls' in Epstein's orbit were victims of his abuse, and they believe Greenfield's client was similarly a victim.",
    "Any interview with the client would be entirely voluntary, with the ability to decline questions, take breaks, and consult counsel.",
    "The investigation seeks information about the client's interactions with Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, including Ghislaine Maxwell, and the nature of any abuse, but emphasizes sensitivity and that specific details are not required in a first meeting."
