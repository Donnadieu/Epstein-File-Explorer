    "The FBI possesses 16 discs containing a forensic image of a computer seized from Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach residence in 2005.",
    "The U.S. Attorney's Office states it lacks a lawful basis to review the contents of these discs because the 2005 warrant authorized seizure but not a search of the device's contents, and no subsequent warrant was obtained.",
    "The government explicitly states it does not intend to obtain a warrant to search the Epstein computer due to the passage of time and other factors.",
    "Therefore, the discs are deemed non-discoverable evidence in the Ghislaine Maxwell case, and defense counsel is barred from reviewing them.",
    "The letter notes that Epstein's estate has refused to waive attorney-client privilege for devices seized from Epstein, creating an additional barrier to review."
