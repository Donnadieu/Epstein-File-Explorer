    "Jeffrey Epstein received between 2 and 4 massages every day when he was in Palm Beach.",
    "The massages were arranged by Epstein's assistants, who would call to notify that 'people were coming at certain time to give JE massages.'",
    "The individuals giving massages were female, described as young 'school girls' of high school age (under 20, not professional masseuses), and wore casual clothes.",
    "The interviewee's impression was that 'all the girls coming to give massages were \"school girls\"' and that they would sometimes talk about school, soccer games, and classes.",
    "Multiple girls would sometimes arrive together, and the interviewee recalls one instance where two girls who seemed like friends came, with one waiting in the kitchen while the other went upstairs for the massage."
