    "Ghislaine Maxwell was mentioned in the 2016 meeting as someone who worked for Epstein, but the interviewee emphasized she was not a focus or target of the presentation.",
    "The interviewee (AUSA 'M') strongly refutes claims in Brad Edwards's book and a Daily News article that she expressed confidence a case would be brought, stating she was deliberately non-committal.",
    "No investigation into Epstein or for perjury related to civil depositions was opened by SDNY until after the publication of the Miami Herald series, which caused the interviewee to re-evaluate her prior assumptions."
