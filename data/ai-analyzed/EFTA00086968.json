    "Prosecutors are preparing a legal filing to address the 'disloyalty clause' in Jeffrey Epstein's trust, which they fear could be used to punish employees or beneficiaries who cooperate with the government.",
    "The filing aims to put employees/beneficiaries added to the trust, particularly since Epstein's arrest, on notice that cooperating should not affect any bequest.",
    "Prosecutors plan to simultaneously seek to enjoin any bequest from the Epstein trust to Ghislaine Maxwell, assuming a criminal action has already been filed against her.",
    "The prosecutors note the trustees are making 'exorbitant and highly unusual sums,' rendering the trust document suspect and suggesting the disloyalty provision could be used for 'nefarious purposes.'",
    "The email discusses the need for a 6(e) court order to allow the use of key trust agreements in a public filing while navigating grand jury secrecy rules."
