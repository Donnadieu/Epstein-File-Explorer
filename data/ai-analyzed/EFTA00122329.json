    "A significant access control weakness was identified: users with limited profiles could access restricted data (like sensitive medical records) when logged onto terminals configured for higher-authorization users.",
    "The BOP's 'SENTRY System Security Guide' did not require routine review of audit log exception reports, and such reports were not being generated or reviewed.",
    "The BOP agreed with most OIG recommendations but requested further discussion on two recommendations (redesigning and modifying the BP-337 form) before providing an official response."
