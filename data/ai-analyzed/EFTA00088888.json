  "summary": "This document is a 2019 academic literature review article titled 'Facilitators and Barriers to Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Update (2000-2016)' published in the journal TRAUMA, VIOLENCE & ABUSE. It synthesizes findings from 33 studies on CSA disclosure patterns, identifying key themes such as disclosure as an iterative process, the influence of social-ecological factors, age and gender as predictors, the lack of a life-course perspective, and that barriers to disclosure outweigh facilitators. The article does not discuss specific individuals or events from the Epstein case; it is a general research review.",
