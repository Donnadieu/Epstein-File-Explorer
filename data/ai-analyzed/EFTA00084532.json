  "summary": "This is a letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York to Judge Alison J. Nathan regarding the proposed protective order in the case against Ghislaine Maxwell. The government opposes two specific modifications requested by the defense: (1) allowing the defense to publicly name victims who have ever spoken publicly about being victims of Epstein or Maxwell, and (2) imposing restrictions on the government's use of its own investigative materials. The government argues for protecting victim privacy under the Crime Victims' Rights Act. This is a proposed protective order filed in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell (20 Cr. 330). The order, issued by Judge Alison J. Nathan, establishes strict rules for handling sensitive discovery materials produced by the government, including confidential witness/victim information and highly confidential sexualized images/videos. It aims to protect privacy, prevent prejudicial publicity, and safeguard the ongoing investigation.",

    "The government strongly opposes the defense's request to be allowed to publicly name any victim who has ever spoken about their abuse in any public forum (media, litigation, social media), arguing it is overly broad and violates victim privacy rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act.",
    "The government's proposed protective order would allow the defense to reference victim names in sealed filings and in private investigative conversations, and to publicly name only those victims who choose to identify themselves on the record in the Maxwell case itself.",
    "The government also opposes the defense's request to impose restrictions on how the government can use its own investigative materials with witnesses, calling this demand unprecedented and without legal basis.",
    "The document reveals a contentious pre-trial dispute over victim protections, with the government accusing the defense of seeking to publicly identify victims for no legitimate trial preparation reason, potentially to harass or discourage witnesses.",
    "The government intends to produce discovery containing sensitive information that could affect privacy, impede the investigation, and risk prejudicial publicity.",
    "Discovery includes 'Highly Confidential Information' defined as containing nude, partially-nude, or otherwise sexualized images, videos, or depictions of individuals.",
    "The order strictly prohibits the public disclosure of the identity of any victims or witnesses referenced in the discovery who have not spoken publicly.",
    "The defendant (Maxwell) is restricted in how she can access and possess the materials, including reviewing highly confidential information only in the presence of her defense counsel.",
    "All discovery materials, including confidential information, must be returned to the government or securely destroyed within a specified period after the conclusion of the case."
