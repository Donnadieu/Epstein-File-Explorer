  "summary": "This is a Government's Memorandum of Law filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, opposing defendants Hamid Akhavan and Ruben Weigand's motions for a bill of particulars. The document argues the indictment and extensive discovery already provided sufficiently detail the bank fraud conspiracy involving the creation of 'Phony Merchants' to process over $100 million in marijuana-related credit/debit transactions, making further particulars unnecessary. This is a government opposition filing (Document 37) in case 1:20-cr-00188-JSR, opposing the defendants' motions for a bill of particulars. The government argues the defendants' requests seek evidentiary detail and previews of the government's case, which is not the purpose of a bill of particulars, and that sufficient information has been provided through the indictment and discovery. This is a government opposition filing in a criminal fraud case (Case 1:20-cr-00188-JSR), responding to defendants' motions for a bill of particulars. The government argues that the detailed indictment and voluminous discovery already provided, including transaction records and communications, give the defendants sufficient information to prepare for trial, making further particulars unnecessary.",

    "The indictment charges Hamid Akhavan and Ruben Weigand with a single count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1349).",
    "The alleged scheme involved creating over a dozen 'Phony Merchants' (fictitious companies selling legal products) to mask and process over $100 million in credit/debit transactions for marijuana sales.",
    "The Government argues it has provided extensive discovery, including communications, financial records, and evidence from a cooperating witness (CW-1), making a bill of particulars unnecessary.",
    "The document details the specific roles: Weigand managed an international network of bank accounts for the Phony Merchants, while both defendants were involved in creating them.",
    "The trial was scheduled to begin on December 1, 2020.",
    "The government is opposing defendants' motions for a bill of particulars, arguing the requests seek evidentiary detail and a preview of the government's case, which is improper.",
    "The charged conspiracy involves an 'Online Marijuana Marketplace Company' and the use of 'Phony Merchants' to deceive issuing banks about the nature of transactions.",
    "The government states its investigation into the scheme and related targets is 'active and ongoing,' and identifying unindicted co-conspirators could jeopardize it.",
    "The government has produced discovery including email/message communications, credit card transaction returns, and information about phony merchants and victim banks.",
    "The government argues the indictment and discovery already provide sufficient notice of the charges, including that over one million miscoded transactions were part of the scheme.",
    "The government argues the indictment and discovery (including a one-terabyte drive of Akhavan's emails and a two-terabyte drive of Weigand's device contents) provide sufficient detail for trial preparation.",
    "The fraud case involves transactions processed through entities named 'Phony Merchants' in the indictment.",
    "The government contends every transaction through the named Phony Merchants was fraudulent, unlike cases where only specific transactions within a large set are alleged to be fraudulent.",
    "The filing cites legal precedents (Bortnovsky, Savin) where bills of particulars were granted due to vague allegations, but argues they are not applicable here because the fraudulent scheme is clearly defined."
