    "The witness, Lieutenant , was the SHU Lieutenant at MCC New York and asserts that it was well-known policy and practice that inmates returning from suicide watch, like Epstein, must have a cellmate. This was communicated via email, verbal instructions, and posted signs in the SHU.",
    "Epstein's cellmate, Efrain Reyes, was removed from the institution (WAB) on August 9, 2019. The interview explores the breakdown in procedure where staff failed to ensure Epstein was given a new cellmate or placed in a hard cell alone for observation after Reyes's departure.",
    "The witness strongly states his belief that Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide (\"Nobody killed that man. He did it himself.\") and defends Correctional Officer Thomas's decision to immediately enter Epstein's cell as an emergency life-saving measure.",
    "The interview reveals significant operational issues at MCC New York, including chronic understaffing, outdated SHU cell infrastructure where inmates control their cell lights, and varying interpretations of policy regarding Lieutenant rounds and counts in the SHU.",
    "A discrepancy in the inmate count slip from the early morning of August 10, 2019, is discussed. The initial slip showed 73 inmates in the SHU (ZA), but the correct count was 72. The witness states he would not have accepted the incorrect count and that it indicates a failure in proper procedure."
