  "summary": "This document is a Bureau of Prisons psychological services record for Jeffrey Epstein, covering his intake, suicide risk assessments, and psychological observations from his arrival at MCC New York on July 6, 2019, to his death on August 10, 2019. It details his mental health evaluations, his placement and removal from suicide watch/psychological observation, an incident on July 23 where a string was found around his neck, and his interactions with prison psychologists and his cellmate. This document contains Bureau of Prisons psychological service notes and suicide risk assessments for inmate Jeffrey Epstein, conducted on July 8-10, 2019, while he was held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York (NYM). The assessments were triggered by his high-profile case and a court proceeding, but clinicians found him at low acute suicide risk with numerous protective factors. This document contains a series of Bureau of Prisons psychology service notes for inmate Jeffrey Epstein from July 9-24, 2019, at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York. It details initial suicide risk assessments, daily clinical contacts, and a significant event on July 23 where Epstein was found with a string around his neck and placed on suicide watch. The notes show Epstein's psychological state, his complaints about jail conditions, and his interactions with staff. This document is a series of Bureau of Prisons psychology reports detailing Jeffrey Epstein's mental health status and interviews following his placement on suicide watch after an incident in the Special Housing Unit (SHU) on July 23, 2019. The reports document his claims of memory loss regarding neck injuries, his denial of suicidality, his complaints about SHU conditions, and his eventual step-down to psychological observation. This document contains a Bureau of Prisons memorandum dated August 10, 2019, summarizing psychological contacts with Jeffrey Epstein from July 8 to August 8, 2019, at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. It details his placement on and removal from suicide watch, an incident where he was found with a string around his neck, and his psychological assessments. The document also includes the full text of the BOP's Suicide Prevention Program policy statement from 2007. This document is a Bureau of Prisons (BOP) policy manual (P5324.08) detailing the procedures for the Suicide Prevention Program. It outlines the roles and responsibilities of the Program Coordinator, conditions for suicide watch, use of inmate observers, transfer protocols, and procedures for analyzing inmate suicides. It includes attachments with a guide for psychological reconstruction of a suicide and a sample information sheet for staff. This document is a collection of Bureau of Prisons administrative records, primarily from the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC). It includes suicide prevention protocols, a record of a 2007 mock suicide training exercise, and numerous logs related to Jeffrey Epstein's suicide watch and inmate status in July 2019. It also contains daily running board counts for the MCC from July 2019. This document is a series of running board logs from the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York, detailing inmate counts, movements, and visits over several days in late July and early August 2019. The logs show the transfer of inmate Jeffrey Epstein (listed as 'Epstein HA') to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) on July 30, 2019, and record the inmate population counts before and after his death.",
