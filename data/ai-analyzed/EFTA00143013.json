    "On July 24, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein was removed from suicide watch after telling a doctor he had 'no interest in killing himself,' had 'lots to do for [his] legal case,' and described his life as 'wonderful.'",
    "Epstein expressed a preference for Psychological Observation over the SHU, claiming his initial unit had 'many MS-13 gang members,' and asked for a 'safer' unit or general population.",
    "Epstein was removed from Psychological Observation on July 30, 2019, after an evaluation by Dr. Imeri found no signs of suicidal ideation, disturbed thought, or immediate danger to self, and noted he was 'future oriented.'",
    "The clinical report, forwarded via email on August 10, 2019, documents the official rationale for discontinuing heightened psychological monitoring of Epstein days before his death.",
    "Epstein discussed practical issues during his evaluation, including lack of sleep due to not having his CPAP machine and problems getting medication."
