    "The prosecution and defense reached an agreement on redactions for Exhibit 11 and a defense cover letter.",
    "The defense reversed its position, requesting that originally proposed redactions on pages 118-119 of the Government's brief remain in place, as they reference a sealed exhibit from a related civil case (v. Maxwell, 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP)).",
    "The Government notes that some defense-proposed redactions would conceal language already publicly available in the filed Indictment, particularly in Count Six.",
    "The defense requested an additional, last-minute redaction on page 134, which the Government agreed to include pending court approval, despite noting it also covers public information."
