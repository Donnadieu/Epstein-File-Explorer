    "In June 2020, investigators were actively subpoenaing Ghislaine Maxwell's Amazon records to track her activity, addresses, and potential new phone numbers.",
    "A U.S. Postal Service (USPS) mail cover was active on Maxwell, meaning her physical mail was being monitored and photocopied as part of the investigation.",
    "Analysis of Maxwell's phone records indicated her phone was 'a lot less active than it was several months ago,' with most calls being incoming or voicemails, prompting investigators to task a CAST team to analyze the records.",
    "The correspondence shows coordination between the NYPD/FBI Child Exploitation Human Trafficking Task Force and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (USANYS) in the investigation leading up to Maxwell's arrest."
