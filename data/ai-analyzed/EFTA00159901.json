  "summary": "This is a psychological research article examining predictors of long-term memory accuracy for documented child sexual abuse (CSA) victims. The study followed individuals with legal experiences from CSA cases, finding that PTSD symptomatology and maternal support were associated with memory accuracy, while factors like abuse severity and legal involvement were also considered. This document is a research paper analyzing the accuracy of long-term memory for child sexual abuse (CSA) using a prospective study design. It examines factors like PTSD symptoms, maternal support, and trauma appraisal, finding that individuals who designated CSA as their most traumatic event and those with more PTSD symptoms had particularly accurate memories. The paper discusses implications for memory retention and legal contexts.",

    "The study found that severity of PTSD symptomatology was positively associated with memory accuracy for documented child sexual abuse.",
    "Individuals who nominated CSA as their most traumatic life event exhibited relatively accurate memory regardless of PTSD indicators.",
    "Maternal support following disclosure was a predictor of memory accuracy, with supported individuals showing better long-term memory.",
    "The research involved 94 individuals (19 males, 75 females) who reported former CSA and were interviewed 12-21 years after the abuse ended.",
    "Memory was coded for accuracy based on 11 points of information from original case documentation, with reliability checks showing high agreement among raters.",
    "The study found that individuals who designated child sexual abuse (CSA) as their most traumatic life event had highly accurate long-term memory for the abuse, regardless of PTSD symptom levels.",
    "Maternal support following disclosure of abuse significantly predicted higher memory accuracy and fewer omission errors.",
    "Greater legal involvement (e.g., potential or actual testimony) was associated with fewer commission errors, possibly due to elaborative rehearsal and stress solidifying memory.",
    "The research was based on a prosecution sample, meaning the CSA cases had been reported to authorities, limiting generalizability to non-reported cases.",
    "The study was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant 0001369."
