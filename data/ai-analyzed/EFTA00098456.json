  "summary": "A letter from attorney Paul G. Cassell to the Metropolitan Police Service in London, written on behalf of an anonymous client (Jane Doe #1), requesting an investigation into international sex trafficking crimes allegedly committed by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The letter is accompanied by a sworn affidavit from the client detailing her alleged sexual abuse and exploitation by Epstein, Maxwell, and others including Prince Andrew, Alan Dershowitz, and Jean Luc Brunel between 1999 and 2002. This document contains a sworn declaration from a victim (Jane Doe 3) detailing her sexual abuse and trafficking by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. She describes being forced into orgies with underage girls, being trafficked to powerful men for blackmail purposes, her escape to Thailand, and her fear of retaliation. The document also includes a 2008 victim notification letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office regarding Epstein's plea deal. This is a sworn declaration by 'Jane Doe 3,' a victim of Jeffrey Epstein, filed in a civil case. She details her abuse, intimidation by Epstein and his lawyer, the failure of authorities to inform her of the 2007 non-prosecution agreement, her subsequent interactions with the FBI and prosecutors, and her belief in a cover-up. The document includes an exhibit of a hotel bill from the Royal Princess Hotel in Thailand, suggesting travel with Epstein. This document contains hotel folios from the Royal Princess Hotel in Chiang Mai, Thailand, for room 923 under the name J. Epstein, covering a stay from September 29 to October 19, 2002. It also includes detailed travel itineraries for 'DOE 3' booked through Shoppers Travel, Inc., showing flights from New York to Thailand and back via Singapore and Frankfurt, with the trip booked under Jeffrey Epstein's address.",
