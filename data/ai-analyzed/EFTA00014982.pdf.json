Pagliuca to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, outlining Ghislaine Maxwell's good faith objections to the government's proffered co-conspirator hearsay statements in her criminal case.

    "One key objection is to a statement where Jeffrey Epstein allegedly told an employee (CC-1) that Maxwell 'used to find girls for him'; the defense characterizes this as inadmissible 'idle chatter' about past events.",
    "The defense seeks to limit the 'minor victims' referenced in the statements to only those specifically identified in the indictment or in an October 11, 2021 government correspondence.",
    "The letter references prior state and federal investigations in Southern Florida that involved 'many alleged minor victims,' implying a broader scope of allegations not all charged in the current case.",
    "The defense cites legal precedents (Lieberman, Lutwak, Krulewitch) to support its argument that the proffered statements were not made 'in the course of or in furtherance of' the charged conspiracy."
