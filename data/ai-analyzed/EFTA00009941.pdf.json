    "The FBI seized a massive amount of digital evidence from Epstein's properties, including terabytes of data from phones, tablets, laptops, desktop computers, servers, DVRs, cameras, and loose media (hard drives, thumb drives, CDs).",
    "Significant technical and coordination problems plagued the evidence review: data was provided in unusable formats, emails were separated from attachments, and there was no clear inventory linking files to specific seized devices.",
    "The U.S. Attorney's Office insisted on using the Relativity e-discovery platform for 'taint review,' which the FBI warned was not a forensic tool and would add months of work while being incapable of viewing all forensic data (like free space and system files).",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic reduced FBI personnel to working one day a week, causing major delays in processing and transferring the evidence.",
    "Evidence included materials from a prior July 2007 search of an Epstein property, with copies found during the 2019/2020 searches."
