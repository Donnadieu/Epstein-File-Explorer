    "The document is a financial record (EFTA00000476) containing account numbers and transaction data.",
    "The text is severely corrupted, making extraction of meaningful names, dates, or specific events impossible.",
    "Account numbers such as 3713-858•72.38009, 3727~332-8~, and 371540tOta7002 are visible but fragmented.",
    "Date fragments like '01/13/2004', '01/13/2008', and '01/13/2005' appear, suggesting transactions over several years.",
