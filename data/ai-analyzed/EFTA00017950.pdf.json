    "Two of the three camera feeds of primary interest for investigating Epstein's death were on a DVR system (system #2) that had suffered hard drive failures on July 29, 2019, and was not recording at the time of his death on August 10, 2019.",
    "The FBI planned to physically remove DVR system #2 for transport to a technical division (OTD) where a team would attempt to rebuild the failed hard drives, acknowledging a significant chance the data was corrupted or encrypted.",
    "The MCC's video surveillance systems had a 30-day overwrite cycle, which was suspended for system #1 on August 12 and system #2 on August 10 to preserve potential evidence.",
    "The email notes that the video extraction and recovery process was complex, would take several weeks, and had a possibility of ultimate failure to recover the desired footage."
