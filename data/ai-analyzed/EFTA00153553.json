    "The US Attorney's Office was actively subpoenaing travel records from multiple airlines (United, American, Delta, Alaska, Southwest, JetBlue) and Expedia in relation to Ghislaine Maxwell in early 2020.",
    "Expedia required additional identifiers like email addresses, credit card numbers, or itinerary numbers to search their records, as their database lacked date of birth information.",
    "The investigation faced timing pressure, with a desire to review airline subpoena results before a trip to California.",
    "JetBlue was not served with a subpoena because confidentiality with the airline was not confirmed; it was also noted JetBlue did not begin flying until 2000.",
    "The correspondence indicates the investigation into Maxwell's travel was ongoing and involved detailed logistical follow-up with various corporations."
