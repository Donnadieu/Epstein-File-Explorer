    "The OIG's 2023 investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's death resulted in eight specific policy recommendations for the BOP, one of which (Recommendation 7) is already closed.",
    "The BOP is in the process of revising multiple Program Statements (5321.09, 5324.08, 5500.14, 5500.15, 4200.12) to address deficiencies in cellmate assignment, suicide prevention, inmate monitoring, and security camera systems.",
    "Despite finding that staffing incentives improved employee retention rates from 83.5% to 88.1%, the BOP eliminated most incentives in March 2025 due to budget constraints.",
    "All remaining recommendations are currently marked as 'Resolved' by the OIG, but final closure is pending BOP completion of policy revisions and submission of finalized documents for OIG review.",
    "The document reveals systemic BOP policy weaknesses related to inmate supervision post-suicide watch, accountability for security rounds, and functionality checks for security camera systems."
