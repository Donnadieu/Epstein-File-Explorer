  "summary": "This is a legal filing by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense attorneys opposing the plaintiff's motion to exceed the standard limit of ten depositions in a defamation lawsuit. The defense argues the request is premature, the proposed depositions are duplicative, cumulative, and irrelevant to the core defamation claim, and that the plaintiff is attempting to improperly expand the scope of the case.",

    "Ghislaine Maxwell's defense argues the plaintiff's request to take 17 depositions is an attempt to improperly expand a simple defamation case into a broader inquiry about Jeffrey Epstein's organization.",
    "The defense states Maxwell fully testified in her deposition, did not invoke the Fifth Amendment, and denied the plaintiff's allegations, which undermines the plaintiff's hope for an adverse inference.",
    "The defense characterizes the plaintiff's allegations as 'fictional' and claims her story 'stands in isolation' because no other witness has claimed Maxwell sexually abused or trafficked them.",
    "Multiple names of proposed deponents (e.g., Marcincova, Kellen, Fontanella) are redacted in the text, indicating they are non-party witnesses the plaintiff wishes to question.",
    "The core legal issue is framed as whether Maxwell's denial of the plaintiff's specific allegations was defamatory and made with actual malice, not the truth of broader patterns of behavior."
