  "summary": "This is a letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York to Judge Robert W. Sweet, requesting a limited order to unseal civil discovery materials held by the law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP. The materials are sought via a grand jury subpoena for an ongoing investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and others for sex trafficking and enticement of minors. The filing argues that the protective order in the civil litigation should be modified to allow compliance with the subpoena.",

  "keyFacts": [
    "The U.S. Attorney's Office was conducting an active, non-public grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and others for sex trafficking and enticement of minors as of February 2019.",
    "The investigation sought discovery materials from the sealed civil lawsuit Giuffre v. Maxwell, et al., which were held by the plaintiffs' law firm, Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP.",
    "The law firm was willing to comply with the grand jury subpoena but felt constrained by a protective order from the civil case, prompting the government's court application.",
    "The government argued that protecting parties from 'embarrassment' is not a valid reason to withhold information from a legitimate law enforcement investigation into serious crimes.",
    "The filing reveals the government's strategic concern about alerting investigation targets (Epstein and others), which could lead to evidence destruction or flight."
