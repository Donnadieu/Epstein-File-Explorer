  "summary": "This is a letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York to Judge Alison J. Nathan, outlining the government's plan to obtain and review investigative files from the prior Florida investigation into Jeffrey Epstein for potential disclosure in the Ghislaine Maxwell case. It details the sources of files, the legal framework for disclosure obligations, and the steps being taken to review materials from various Florida agencies. This is a government filing from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan, dated October 7, 2020. It details the prosecution's planned approach to reviewing materials from prior, separate investigations (specifically the USAO-SDFL's Florida investigation and USAO-SDGA's CVRA civil litigation) for potential Giglio or 3500 material relevant to the Ghislaine Maxwell prosecution, while arguing those prior offices are not part of the current prosecution team.",
