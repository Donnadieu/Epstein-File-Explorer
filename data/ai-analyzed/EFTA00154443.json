    "The legal opinion concludes that France can legally extradite its own citizens to the U.S. under the existing Extradition Treaty, which contains no prohibition, contrary to the U.S. government's claim at Maxwell's bail hearing.",
    "Ghislaine Maxwell executed an irrevocable waiver of her right to contest extradition from France to the U.S., intended to be used if she fled to France after release on bail.",
    "The opinion states that if Maxwell fled to France in violation of bail, it is highly likely she would be placed in custody there and that French authorities would likely grant extradition due to her U.S. citizenship, the waiver, and diplomatic considerations.",
    "The document analyzes French extradition procedure, noting that if a person consents to extradition, the judicial process can be completed within approximately 14 working days after arrest.",
    "The opinion clarifies that the principle against extraditing nationals is not a constitutional rule in France and is superseded by treaties like the one with the U.S., making extradition of a French citizen legally permissible."
