    "Victim notification was a key issue; the AUSA states several victims had expressed concerns about identity exposure at trial and desired a prompt resolution, and none of Bradley Edwards' clients had expressed a desire to be consulted prior to the agreement.",
    "Attorney James Eisenberg represented a victim, and his fees were paid by Jeffrey Epstein, the target of the investigation.",
    "The AUSA could not include one victim in the official list provided to Epstein's counsel because, based on her prior statements to law enforcement, she could not in good faith be named in a federal indictment."
