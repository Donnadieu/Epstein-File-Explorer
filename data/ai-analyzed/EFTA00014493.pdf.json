  "keyFacts": [
    "The government obtained financial records showing Jeffrey Epstein made two large, suspicious payments in late 2018: $100,000 and $250,000 to individuals named as potential co-conspirators or employees who facilitated abuse, shortly after the Miami Herald published exposés.",
    "During a July 2019 search of Epstein's Manhattan home, law enforcement seized a foreign passport with Epstein's photo but a different name, suggesting the capability to obtain false travel documents and assume foreign identities.",
    "The same safe contained over $70,000 in cash and 48 loose diamonds, which the government argued were consistent with the capability to flee the jurisdiction at a moment's notice.",
    "The identities of the two payment recipients are redacted in the public filing, as they are potential co-conspirators protected under the 2007 non-prosecution agreement and were featured in the Miami Herald series.",
    "The government argues this evidence, combined with prior submissions, demonstrates Epstein poses a serious flight risk and danger to the community, warranting detention pending trial."
