    "There was confusion and inconsistency regarding the ligature (noose) evidence collected from the scene; the examiner expressed doubt that the item presented to her was the actual one used.",
    "Toxicology tests detected no substances in Epstein's system at the time of death.",
    "The medical examiner stated that no one attempted to coerce or bribe her into ruling the death a suicide, though she received unpleasant calls from Epstein's family who were unhappy with the determination."
