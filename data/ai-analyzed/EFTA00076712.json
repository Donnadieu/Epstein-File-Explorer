    "The investigation indicates Epstein's sexual abuse of minors started earlier than previously charged (as early as 1994) and that Ghislaine Maxwell participated in facilitating and engaging in the abuse, including transporting and enticing at least one minor victim.",

    "Emails extracted from seized devices show Ghislaine Maxwell communicating with other individuals about recruiting young women for Epstein and arranging for 'girls' for another individual's trips."
