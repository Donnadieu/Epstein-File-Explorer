  "keyFacts": [
    "Epstein was given a 15-minute phone call on a legal line on the evening of August 9, 2019, shortly before he was found deceased. The call was not monitored or logged, which the witness admits was a failure.",
    "Epstein's cellmate, Reyes, was transferred (WAB) out of MCC on the morning of August 9, 2019. Epstein was left without a cellmate, contrary to requirements. The witness states the responsibility for ensuring a replacement cellmate fell on the SHU lieutenant or captain.",
    "The witness states it was common practice at MCC for staff to give inmates unauthorized phone calls on legal lines, and that proper monitoring/logging procedures and equipment (like a logbook) were not in place at the time.",
    "The witness took pictures of Epstein's deceased body at the hospital with his personal phone and sent them to an Associate Warden, then deleted them. He did this to document the time of departure and provide proof of death.",
    "The witness speculates that the official response to Epstein's hanging may have been improper, suggesting it's unlikely a single officer could have cut down a hanging inmate of Epstein's size without proper tools and assistance, and that entering a cell alone in such a situation is against policy."
