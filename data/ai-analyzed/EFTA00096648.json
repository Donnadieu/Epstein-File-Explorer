    "Sarah Kellen scheduled hundreds of massage appointments for Epstein from 2002-2005, during which he sexually abused dozens of minors aged 14-17.",
    "Three victims reported to law enforcement that Sarah Kellen witnessed or participated in abusive incidents: Victim-1 reported Kellen was present and participated; Victim-2 reported Kellen walked in during oral sex; Victim-3 reported Kellen walked in while she was nude.",
    "In 2005, after learning of the investigation, Kellen at Epstein's direction called multiple minor victims to dissuade them from cooperating with law enforcement, offering legal help and financial incentives.",
    "The document reveals internal prosecution strategy, including a preference to resolve the case via a guilty plea rather than trial, due to victim preferences and the desire to avoid a Fatico hearing.",
    "Victim identities and their preferences are detailed: Victim-1 is publicly identified; Victim-2 uses a pseudonym; Victim-3's identity was inadvertently released and she wishes to remain anonymous."
