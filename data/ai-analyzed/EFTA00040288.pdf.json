  "summary": "This document is a series of forwarded emails from whistleblower Christopher J. Dilorio to various SEC officials and judges, primarily dated between June and December 2020. It details Dilorio's allegations of massive, ongoing SEC corruption, obstruction of justice, and facilitation of financial fraud, specifically related to Knight Capital/Virtu Financial (NITE), Blackstone, and various 'money laundering shell' companies. He appeals a preliminary denial of his whistleblower award and accuses the SEC of creating rules to deny him compensation while protecting powerful entities. This document is a lengthy whistleblower complaint and appeal from Christopher Dilorio to the SEC Office of the Whistleblower (OWB), primarily addressed to Jane Norberg. Dilorio alleges the SEC has used his information (submitted via TCRs since 2011) to both bring and obstruct enforcement actions, while denying him compensation. He details a complex, ongoing scheme involving market maker Knight Capital/Virtu (NITE), UBS (UBSS), and various shell companies (e.g., CGFIA, APCX, IMDS) used for money laundering via abusive naked shorting in the OTC markets. He accuses the SEC of criminal obstruction, covering up for NITE and UBSS, and facilitating a massive fraud on the public.",

    "Christopher Dilorio, a self-proclaimed whistleblower, alleges a vast conspiracy of corruption and obstruction within the SEC, protecting powerful entities like Blackstone, Virtu Financial (NITE), and various 'bag men' involved in money laundering through OTC market shells.",
    "He claims the SEC created a new whistleblower rule (Rule 240.21F-18) specifically to deny him an award by allowing denial if 'staff never saw' the information, which he dubs 'The Christopher J Dilorio Rule.'",
    "Dilorio alleges Knight Capital/Virtu Financial's subsidiary NITE is perpetually insolvent due to its core business of 'abusive naked shorting' of OTC shells to facilitate money laundering, a fraud actively facilitated by the SEC.",
    "He connects multiple financial and political figures, including Steve Schwarzman (Blackstone), Jared Kushner, Donald Trump, and Jeffrey Epstein, to alleged frauds such as the Eastman Kodak (KODK) loan and Blink Charging (BLNK).",
    "The emails reference SEC officials (Jay Clayton, Lara Shalov Mehraban, Dick Best) having undisclosed conflicts of interest through former law firm colleagues (Sullivan & Cromwell, Paul Weiss) who represent or are involved with the entities under allegation.",
    "The whistleblower, Christopher Dilorio, alleges the SEC has used his TCR information since 2011 to both bring enforcement actions (e.g., against Oppenheimer, Joshua Sason, Justin Keener) and to obstruct investigations, particularly those involving market maker Knight Capital/Virtu (NITE) and UBS (UBSS).",
    "A core allegation is that NITE and UBSS are the primary executing brokers converting 'worthless certificates' from OTC shell companies (like CGFIA, APCX, IMDS) into real money through abusive naked shorting, facilitating a massive money laundering scheme.",
    "Dilorio cites the DTCC's 2013 'Global Lock' on CGFIA stock as 'irrefutable evidence' of naked shorting by a third-party broker-dealer, which he implies is NITE, and questions why the SEC did not fully investigate this.",
    "He accuses the SEC of criminal obstruction, specifically protecting NITE (e.g., via the 2012 'glitch' bailout) and UBSS, and alleges conflicts of interest involving SEC officials like Chairman Jay Clayton and former Enforcement officials.",
    "The document claims the SEC Whistleblower Office denied Dilorio's award for the Oppenheimer action based on the false pretext that 'investigators never saw his information,' which he argues is the OWB's own responsibility to distribute."
