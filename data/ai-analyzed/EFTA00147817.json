    "A prior search of Epstein's NYC residence initially sought only pictures and proof of residency but expanded, resulting in 845 photos taken over 13 hours.",
    "The email indicates an effort to isolate the 2019 case from the investigation into Epstein that occurred approximately 12 years prior.",
    "Coordination involved multiple law enforcement partners including CBP (Customs and Border Protection) and USCG (U.S. Coast Guard)."
