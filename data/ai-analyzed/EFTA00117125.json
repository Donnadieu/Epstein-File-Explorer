    "The interview is part of the official DOJ OIG investigation into the death of inmate Jeffrey Epstein and surrounding circumstances.",
    "Documentation shows inmate was scheduled for transfer from MCC to a private prison (GO) on August 9, 2019, and was not going to court as previously uncertain.",
    "BOP procedures indicate that when an inmate is marked 'WAB' (With All Belongings) on call-out lists, housing unit staff should know the inmate is leaving permanently.",
    "The interview reveals that call-out lists created in the Sentry system are typically deleted daily and not maintained long-term, making them difficult to obtain for investigations.",
    "Control center officers are responsible for immediately updating inmate location changes in the system to maintain accurate counts for emergency situations."
