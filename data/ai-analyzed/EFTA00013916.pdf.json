    "Prosecutors expressed significant internal frustration that the Epstein case was being treated differently than other child exploitation cases, despite involving 'more than 20 known child victims'.",
    "A key concern was the statute of limitations under state law (believed to be two years), which threatened to bar prosecution for a 'second set' of victims if the case was delayed further.",
    "The prosecution was actively working to prevent further delays, with the U.S. Attorney (Acosta) preparing to present arguments to the Deputy Attorney General (DAG) on May 28, 2008.",
    "Victim testimony indicated Epstein was aware of victims' minor status, with one victim ('El') stating she told him her age (14 or 15) and he said he 'did not care about age'.",
    "The emails reference a pre-negotiated deal where Epstein had agreed to plead to uncharged crimes and pay damages to victims, a term he could escape if the case was stalled."
