      "description": "For approximately two weeks, inmate food slots on cell doors in multiple housing units were discovered left unsecured or tampered with (e.g., tied with strings, stuffed with paper) by inmates, posing grave security risks.

    "A critical security failure occurred where inmate food slots were left unsecured or sabotaged, allowing potential contraband (drugs, cell phones, weapons) smuggling and creating an escape risk.",
    "The issue persisted for two weeks, indicating systemic staff negligence and inadequate supervision, particularly during the Morning Watch shift with minimal staffing.",
    "Inmates actively resisted correction by tying strings around locking devices and stuffing paper into locks to prevent staff from securing the slots.",
    "The email criticizes leadership failures, including lack of incident reports, administrative detention for involved inmates, and insufficient on-the-spot training for unit officers.",
    "The document implies a permissive culture, as housing unit officers were reportedly informed it was 'okay to leave the inmate food slots open,' necessitating an urgent all-staff directive to cease the practice."
