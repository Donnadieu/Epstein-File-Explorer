  "summary": "This is a court order by Judge Alison J. Nathan granting a short continuance of Ghislaine Maxwell's trial from July 2021 to fall 2021. The continuance is granted due to the government's late filing of an S2 Superseding Indictment, which added new charges and an alleged victim, requiring additional defense preparation time. The order balances the defense's need to prepare against the public interest in a timely trial.",
