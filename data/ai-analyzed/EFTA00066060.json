    "The production involved an anonymizing index and cover letters specifying that native/text files in a specific Bates range (SDNY_00008724 - SDNY_00013257) were confidential despite lacking a physical stamp.",
    "The document workflow shows internal coordination on redaction decisions, with specific uncertainty about withholding information related to Tartaglione that also involved Epstein."
