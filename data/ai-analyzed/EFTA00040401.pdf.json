  "summary": "This document is a series of emails from Christopher J. Dilorio, a self-proclaimed whistleblower, sent between November 2020 and December 2020. The emails allege widespread corruption, obstruction, and criminal facilitation by the SEC, FINRA, and other financial institutions, specifically protecting entities like Knight Capital/KCG/Virtu Financial (NITE) involved in money laundering, naked short selling, and fraud via OTC markets and shell companies. Dilorio references his own TCR (Tip, Complaint, or Referral) submissions and claims the SEC uses his information for selective enforcement while shielding key players.",
