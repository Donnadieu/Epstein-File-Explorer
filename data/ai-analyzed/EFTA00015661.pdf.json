  "summary": "This is a transcript of Jeffrey Epstein's initial appearance, arraignment, and bail hearing before Magistrate Judge Henry B. Pitman in the Southern District of New York on July 8, 2019. The government argues for pretrial detention based on Epstein's extreme wealth, risk of flight, danger to the community, and evidence from a recent search of his home. Epstein's defense counsel argues the charges are a 'do-over' of a previously resolved Florida case and requests time to propose a bail package.",
