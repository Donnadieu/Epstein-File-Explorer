  "summary": "This is a court order by Judge Alison J. Nathan addressing a complaint from Ghislaine Maxwell's defense counsel regarding her sleeping conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC). The complaint alleged that guards were shining flashlights in her eyes every 15 minutes at night, disrupting her sleep and trial preparation. The court, after receiving a response from the government explaining the Bureau of Prisons' standard safety protocols, denied the request for relief as factually unsubstantiated but urged the MDC to consider reducing sleep disruption for pre-trial detainees.",

    "Defense counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell complained that guards at the MDC were shining a flashlight in her eyes every 15 minutes at night, disrupting her sleep and trial preparation.",
    "The government responded that MDC staff conduct flashlight checks of all inmates as standard procedure, with more frequent checks for Maxwell due to her being housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the high-profile nature of the case.",
    "Judge Alison J. Nathan denied the defense's request to override BOP protocols, finding it factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported, but urged the MDC to consider reducing sleep disruption for pre-trial detainees.",
    "The order states that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but Maxwell may use other non-contraband items to cover her eyes.",
    "The court ordered the government to provide a copy of the order to the Warden and General Counsel for the MDC."
