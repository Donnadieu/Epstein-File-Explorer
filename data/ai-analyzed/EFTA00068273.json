    "The officer described systemic problems at MCC, including officers being exhausted, \"zombie-like,\" and routinely cutting corners by falsifying 30-minute round logs due to burnout from excessive mandated overtime.",
    "The officer verified his signature on the 10pm count slip for August 9 but stated he did not assist with the count, meaning Officer Noel would have had to call in a count by herself, which violated the two-officer policy.",
    "The officer had post-death conversations with Officer Noel, who was scared and reluctant to talk, and with another officer who reassured him that Epstein \"didn't die on his watch.\""
