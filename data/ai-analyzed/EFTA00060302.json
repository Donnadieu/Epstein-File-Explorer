  "keyFacts": [
    "The Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) New York's camera system was critically degraded in 2018, with two 96-channel DVRs having repeatedly failed, leaving areas without video coverage and using obsolete, unsupportable technology.",
    "An $800,000 project was approved to replace the system with a new 350-channel NVR system, install 272 cameras, and provide training, with an estimated completion date of February 9, 2019.",
    "The procurement process involved a vendor, Anixter, and a subsequent contract modification in September 2019 adjusted a purchase order related to the project.",
    "The document highlights standard bureaucratic procedures for major facility upgrades within the Federal Bureau of Prisons, including justifications, cost estimates, and multi-level approvals.",
    "No individuals are named in these procedural and technical procurement documents; all references are to positions, departments, or the vendor company.",
    "The Bureau of Prisons cited an 'urgent and compelling need' to replace a failing 96-channel DVR system at MCC New York due to safety and security risks for inmates and staff.",
    "The contract, valued at $698,108.99, was awarded non-competitively to SigNet Technologies, Inc. under a limited-sources justification.",
    "The justification states that public posting of the procurement was avoided due to security risks, as it would reveal the prison's 'unstable and often-inoperable video recording system.'",
    "The existing DVR system had 'failed repeatedly, leaving critical areas of the institution without video coverage,' and used obsolete technology with no available replacement parts.",
    "The new NICE Vision system was required to be connected to the BOPNET WAN system following strict IPv6 protocol standards, a system already approved and maintained by SigNet."
