    "Tartaglione's account differed, stating he was asleep, felt something hit his legs, turned on the light, and saw Epstein with a string around his neck before calling the guards.",
    "The report notes Epstein exhibited unpredictable behavior after the incident, including pretending to be unconscious when staff made eye contact and attempting to fall forward head-first while on suicide watch.",
    "Medical assessment was delayed as no medical staff was available after 10:00 p.m.; when examined, Epstein had a circular line of erythema at the base of his neck with friction marks."
