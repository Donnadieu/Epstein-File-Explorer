    "The FBI was actively planning the operational details for Jeffrey Epstein's arrest as of July 3, 2019.",
    "The plan involved a two-wave deployment of FBI agents to Florida: first to serve subpoenas to co-conspirators, then to conduct 'knock and talk' interviews with victims.",
    "The SDNY (Southern District of New York) directed that no agents from the Miami field office be used, to keep this investigation separate from the prior 2008 Miami case involving Epstein.",
    "The email seeks authorization to use an EAN (likely a government travel authorization number) for the agent deployments, indicating the operation was in its logistical planning phase."
