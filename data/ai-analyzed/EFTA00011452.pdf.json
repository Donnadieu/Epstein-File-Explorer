  "summary": "This is a legal memorandum filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense attorneys in support of a motion to suppress evidence and dismiss perjury counts (Five and Six). The motion argues the government obtained Maxwell's civil deposition transcripts unlawfully by making false statements to a judge to circumvent a protective order, violating due process. It details the protective order in a prior defamation case, Maxwell's reliance on it during depositions, and alleged collusion between the government and the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner.",

  "keyFacts": [
    "The motion seeks to suppress all evidence obtained from Boies Schiller Flexner LLP via grand jury subpoena and to dismiss perjury Counts Five and Six, which are based on Maxwell's 2016 civil deposition transcripts.",
    "It alleges the government made false statements to Judge McMahon, claiming no prior contact with Boies Schiller and that the firm did not instigate the investigation, when in fact the firm had approached prosecutors multiple times starting in February 2016.",
    "A protective order in the prior civil case strictly limited disclosure of confidential material and lacked a 'law enforcement' exception; Maxwell relied on this order in giving deposition testimony instead of invoking the Fifth Amendment.",
    "After the case settled, Maxwell demanded the return or destruction of confidential materials per the protective order, but Boies Schiller refused and later produced approximately 90,000 pages to the government.",
    "Magistrate Judge Netburn rejected an identical government request in a different civil case, criticizing the attempt to side-step protective order protections."
