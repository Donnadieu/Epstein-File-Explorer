  "summary": "This is a motion filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense attorneys in a civil case (15-cv-07433-RWS) in the Southern District of New York. The motion seeks to compel the plaintiff (an unnamed alleged victim) to disclose information about alleged ongoing criminal investigations involving Maxwell, or, alternatively, to stay the civil proceedings. The defense argues the plaintiff has repeatedly referenced such investigations but refuses to provide details, and that Assistant U.S. Attorney A. Marie Villafana stated she was unaware of any such investigation.",
