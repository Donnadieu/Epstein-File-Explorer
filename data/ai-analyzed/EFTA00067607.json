It also includes summaries of other unrelated cases: a major horse racing doping scandal, the hung jury in the CIA leak trial of Joshua Schulte, the arrest of Lawrence Ray for alleged sex trafficking, commentary on SDNY independence, criticism of Attorney General Barr, and an injury to Harvey Weinstein in jail.",
