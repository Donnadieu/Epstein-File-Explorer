  "summary": "This is an FBI Laboratory case record (Lab #2020-01577) detailing forensic questioned document examinations. The case involves analyzing a greeting card and envelope addressed to Larry Nassar, comparing them against documents purported to contain the known handwriting of Jeffrey Epstein. The examiner concludes meaningful comparisons could not be conducted due to a lack of verified, comparable known writing samples. This document is a collection of Bureau of Prisons records related to Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration at MCC New York in July 2019, including his medical status, commissary lists, an incident report of a suicide attempt, and disciplinary hearing notices. It also includes an FBI Laboratory case file (2020-01577) concerning a questioned documents examination of items possibly linked to Epstein, including a greeting card and envelope addressed to Larry Nassar. This document consists of two parts: a series of product catalog pages from 'artefacto.com' dated September 8, 2014, and an email exchange between FBI agents on August 11, 2020, regarding the submission and processing of evidence (Lab #2020-01577, case NY-3151227) to the FBI Laboratory's Questioned Documents Unit. This document is a collection of FBI internal emails, a laboratory examination request, and related forms concerning a forensic handwriting analysis. The FBI's Questioned Documents Unit is attempting to determine if a letter addressed to Larry Nassar, found as 'return to sender' at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, was written by Jeffrey Epstein. The correspondence reveals difficulties in obtaining verified handwriting samples from Epstein for comparison.",
