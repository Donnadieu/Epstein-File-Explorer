    "The NYC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) completed a full autopsy report on Jeffrey Epstein, concluding his death was a suicide.",
    "The U.S. Attorney's Office provided sensitive investigative materials to OCME for the autopsy, including a draft FBI 302 of an interview with a key MCC guard witness (Lt.).",
    "The U.S. Attorney's Office requested OCME redact sensitive materials (like guard names, witness statements, and MCC documents) from the autopsy report before releasing it to Epstein's brother, Mark Epstein, to protect the ongoing investigation.",
    "A handwritten note was found in Epstein's cell at the time of his death. Authorities assessed it as a list of grievances about prison conditions, not a suicide note.",
    "The OCME follows a policy of releasing autopsy reports to next of kin in suicide cases but typically withholds them in homicide cases out of respect for ongoing investigations."
