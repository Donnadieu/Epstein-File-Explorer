    "The author proposes a specific investigative strategy: have U.S. Attorneys contact NYC domestic staffing agencies (Pavillion, Greenhouse, Robert Party Consulting, British American Household Staffing) to access records and interview staff who worked for Epstein.",
    "The author claims domestic staff (housekeepers, chefs, drivers, etc.) see and hear everything, know who comes and goes, and have access to all properties, making them key witnesses.",
    "The author states they once owned a domestic agency, placed staff with Epstein, and heard about his activities long before his Florida conviction, but lacked evidence.",
    "The email includes a transactional request: in return for the strategy, the recipient should be more aggressive in prosecuting ADA violations, specifically naming Reading International, Bill de Blasio, and Mitchell Silver.",
    "The document is correspondence from a disability advocate offering unsolicited investigative advice, highlighting a potential avenue for evidence collection via employment agency records."
