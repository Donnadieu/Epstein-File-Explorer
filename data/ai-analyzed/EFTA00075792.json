  "summary": "This is a defense expert disclosure filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's legal team in her criminal case (20 Cr. 330). The document outlines the expected testimony of two defense experts, Dr. Elizabeth Loftus and Dr. Park Dietz, who will challenge the reliability of witness memories, the concept of 'grooming,' and the validity of sexual assault allegations in the case. This document appears to be a defense filing in the Ghislaine Maxwell case, likely a notice of expert witnesses. It contains a lengthy discussion of psychological factors that can lead to false allegations of sexual assault, followed by a list of defense expert witnesses and their proposed testimony areas.",
