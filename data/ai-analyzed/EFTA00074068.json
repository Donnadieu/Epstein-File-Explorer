  "summary": "This is an addendum legal opinion by David Perry QC regarding English extradition law as it pertains to Ghislaine Maxwell's case. It responds to the US Government's opposition to Maxwell's motion for release, concluding that Maxwell would almost certainly be extradited to the US if she fled to England and Wales, that bail would be refused due to her prior absconding, and that the UK Secretary of State has very limited discretion to refuse extradition.",

  "keyFacts": [
    "The opinion concludes it is 'highly unlikely' Ghislaine Maxwell could successfully resist extradition from England and Wales to the US.",
    "If Maxwell absconded from US bail and then tried to resist extradition in the UK, bail would 'almost certainly be refused' during UK proceedings.",
    "The UK Secretary of State has refused extradition only once since 2003 (in the Gary McKinnon case), illustrating the exceptional nature of this power.",
    "Maxwell's waiver of extradition, if used to secure US bail and then breached, would be viewed as 'bad faith' and make her evidence less credible.",
    "Most extradition cases from England and Wales to the US conclude within two years, or three months if consent is given."
