  "summary": "This is a transcript of a voluntary sworn interview conducted by the DOJ Office of the Inspector General (OIG) with a Bureau of Prisons Lieutenant at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York. The interview focuses on the circumstances surrounding the death of inmate Jeffrey Epstein, specifically the procedures and knowledge regarding Epstein's required cellmate status and the events of August 9-10, 2019. This is a transcript of an OIG interview with a BOP Lieutenant (Grijalva) regarding the events at MCC New York on August 9-10, 2019, the day before Jeffrey Epstein's death. The interview focuses on inmate counts, rounds, cell assignments, staff responsibilities, and the failure to assign Epstein a new cellmate after his cellmate Reyes was released. The witness discusses potential falsification of count slips, camera functionality, and systemic issues within the SHU.",

    "The witness, a BOP Lieutenant, created and posted a bright orange sign at the SHU OIC computer stating 'Mandatory rounds must be conducted every 30 minutes on Epstein, as per God.' He placed it there a few weeks after Epstein returned from suicide watch, prior to August 9.",
    "Standard BOP procedure, reinforced in SHU and annual training, required inmates coming off suicide watch (on the 'hot list') to be housed with a cellmate. The witness states this was common knowledge among regular SHU staff.",
    "On August 9, 2019, the witness knew inmate Efrain Reyes, Epstein's cellmate, was being pre-removed (WAB) from the MCC. He states he verbally communicated this and the resulting need for Epstein to have a new cellmate to oncoming officers.",
    "The witness's understanding was that Psychology, not higher-level BOP officials like the Warden or Regional Director, was responsible for vetting and recommending appropriate cellmates for Epstein based on factors like age.",
    "The interview reveals potential gaps in knowledge: Officers working overtime or those who hadn't completed quarterly SHU training might not have known about the cellmate requirement for inmates on the suicide 'hot list' like Epstein.",
    "Inmate Reyes, Epstein's cellmate, was released (WAB) on August 9, 2019. Grijalva, the SHU OIC, states he informed his relief (Shakir) and Lieutenants (Layne, Perez) that Epstein would need a new cellmate if Reyes didn't return, but no new cellmate was ever assigned.",
    "Count slips for the SHU on August 9-10 appear to have been falsified. The numbers matched the incorrect institutional count because an inmate (Fernandez) moved to a dry cell was not keyed out of SHU until midnight, suggesting staff did not conduct physical counts but instead wrote down the expected number.",
    "Epstein was housed in cell 220 in L Tier, but the BOP system incorrectly showed him assigned to cell 206L. This was an administrative error that would have been caught by a weekly bed book count.",
    "Case Manager Bullock allegedly authorized Epstein to make a phone call from the shower on a non-recorded line on August 9, 2019. The call was not monitored as required if it was not a legal call.",
    "Grijalva believes Epstein's death was a suicide and that having a cellmate would have made it 'less likely.' He attributes systemic issues like staff shortages, laziness, and miscommunication as contributing factors, but does not believe there was foul play by staff."
