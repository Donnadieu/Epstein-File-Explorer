    "Discovery included over 1.2 million documents, with materials recovered from Jeffrey Epstein's devices and flight logs produced by David Rodgers.",
    "The defense raised specific issues about missing Bates ranges, overlapping document productions, and the need for metadata correlating documents to specific devices ('Subject Devices').",
    "The prosecution stated that an FBI report from Epstein's devices contained redactions that existed at the time of recovery, not applied by the government, and declined to provide a redaction log without legal authority.",
    "A search warrant affidavit for a cell-site simulator used to track Maxwell's phone was referenced as being unsealed in the District of New Hampshire, which the prosecution stated happened automatically per a court order, not due to government action."
