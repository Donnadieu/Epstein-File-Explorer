  "summary": "This is a July 8, 2019, government motion filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, requesting that Jeffrey Epstein be detained pending trial. It argues Epstein is an extreme flight risk and danger to the community due to his wealth, international travel, lack of ties, and the serious charges of sex trafficking minors. It references the 2005-2008 Florida investigation and a prior non-prosecution agreement. This is a government memorandum submitted to Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman opposing bail for Jeffrey Epstein. It argues Epstein poses an exceptionally high risk of flight and danger to the community, citing his vast wealth, international ties, prior conviction, alleged witness tampering, and the discovery of lewd photographs in his home.",
