  "summary": "This document is a series of emails from whistleblower Christopher J. Dilorio to various judges and SEC officials, primarily dated September 11, 2020. Dilorio appeals the SEC's preliminary denial of his whistleblower award claim for the Oppenheimer AML covered action (2015-016). He alleges extensive SEC and DOJ obstruction, claiming the SEC uses his information to both bring and obstruct complaints while denying him compensation. He details a complex web of alleged financial crimes involving Knight Capital/KCG/Virtu (NITE), UBS, Jefferies, and others, centered on abusive naked short selling and money laundering via OTC market shells.",
