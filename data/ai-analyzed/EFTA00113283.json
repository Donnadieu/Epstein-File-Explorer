    "Significant discrepancies existed in inmate count slips for the SHU on August 9-10. Inmate Angel Fernandez was moved to a dry cell in R&D at 3:15 p.m. on August 9 but was not keyed out of the SHU, causing the SHU count to be off by one (reporting 73 instead of 72) for multiple counts.",
    "The witness acknowledges writing '9S+1' on an R&D count slip and possibly a '+1' on a SHU count slip during the 10:00 p.m. count on August 9, stating it would have been at the direction of the Operations Lieutenant, Nicole, to reflect a 'ghost count.'",
    "The witness states that Epstein's cellmate, Efrain Reyes, was removed from the MCC on August 9, leaving Epstein alone in his cell, and speculates that Epstein was prematurely removed from suicide watch.",
    "The witness identifies systemic problems at the MCC, primarily a critical lack of staff, high turnover, and mandatory overtime, which he believes contributed to the failures leading to Epstein's death."
