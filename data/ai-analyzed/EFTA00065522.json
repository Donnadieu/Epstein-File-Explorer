    "The Government is opposing the defense's proposed November 15, 2021 deadline for filing a Rule 412 motion, arguing the court has authority to set an earlier deadline.",
    "Federal Rule of Evidence 412 restricts evidence about a victim's other sexual behavior to protect victim privacy, with exceptions that require a pretrial motion.",
    "The Government argues an earlier deadline is needed to properly investigate and hold necessary in-camera hearings before trial, especially with multiple victim witnesses.",
    "The document cites several legal precedents (Rivera, Andrews, Backman, Smith) supporting a court's discretion to set Rule 412 motion deadlines more than 14 days before trial.",
    "The trial schedule, combined with the Thanksgiving holiday, is cited as a practical reason against the defense's proposed late filing date."
