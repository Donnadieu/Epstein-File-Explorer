    "Some evidence items, specifically two servers with multiple drives, are noted as physically failed and require specialized hardware recovery, which is described as a potentially long and uncertain process.",
    "The correspondence indicates that, aside from one missing thumb drive (NYC027913) and the physically failed drives, the evidence production was considered complete as of August 2020.",
