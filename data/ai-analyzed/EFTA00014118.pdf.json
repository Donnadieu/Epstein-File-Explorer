    "In September 2008, The Palm Beach Daily News, through its attorney Bryce Albu, discovered the existence of a sealed non-prosecution agreement related to Jeffrey Epstein's case and made a Florida Public Records Act request.",
    "The sealed agreement referenced is the Federal Non-Prosecution Agreement that was filed under seal by a judge at the time of Jeffrey Epstein's plea.",
    "U.S. Attorney's Office personnel acknowledged being bound by a non-disclosure agreement regarding the sealed pact, creating a conflict when faced with the public records request.",
    "The email chain shows the State Attorney's Office (Barry Krischer) deferring to the U.S. Attorney's Office for guidance on how to handle the newspaper's request, as the federal office was a signatory to the sealed agreement.",
    "The document reveals early media and legal scrutiny of the secrecy surrounding the Epstein plea deal, years before it became widely publicized."
