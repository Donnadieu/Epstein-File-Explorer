  "summary": "This is a legal memorandum filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense attorneys in support of a motion to dismiss Counts One through Four of the superseding indictment as time-barred. The document argues that the charges, based on alleged conduct from 1994-1997, are barred by the five-year statute of limitations and that the government's reliance on a 2003 amendment extending the limitations period for child abuse offenses is improper because it should not apply retroactively and does not cover the Mann Act violations she is charged with.",

    "The defense argues the charges (Counts 1-4) from 1994-1997 are time-barred by the general 5-year statute of limitations (18 U.S.C. § 3282).",
    "The defense contends the 2003 amendment to 18 U.S.C. § 3283 (extending the limitations period for child abuse offenses) should not apply retroactively to pre-2003 conduct, citing legislative history where Congress rejected a retroactivity provision.",
    "The defense argues that even if the 2003 amendment applied, § 3283 does not cover the charged Mann Act offenses (18 U.S.C. §§ 2422, 2423) because they do not 'necessarily entail' the sexual/physical abuse or kidnapping of a child as an element of the crime.",
    "The memorandum references three accusers, including 'Minor Victim-1' and 'Minor Victim-3', the latter of whom turned 25 in March 2002, making charges related to her time-barred even before the 2003 amendment.",
    "The filing is a strategic legal argument focusing on statutory interpretation and the presumption against retroactivity, not a factual rebuttal of the underlying allegations."
