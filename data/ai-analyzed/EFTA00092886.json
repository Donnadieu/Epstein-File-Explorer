  "summary": "This is a 2021 opinion and order by Judge Alison J. Nathan resolving Ghislaine Maxwell's pretrial motions in her criminal case. The court denies most motions, including those to dismiss based on Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement and statute of limitations, but grants the motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. The opinion analyzes the scope and applicability of Epstein's NPA in detail. This document is a court opinion/order (Document 207) filed in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell (Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN). It addresses several defense motions to dismiss the indictment, focusing on the statute of limitations, pre-indictment delay, specificity of charges, and the legal tenability of perjury counts. The court denies the motions, finding the charges valid under the PROTECT Act and that Maxwell failed to show sufficient prejudice from delay. This is a court opinion and order (Document 207) from Judge Alison J. Nathan in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell. The court denies most of Maxwell's pretrial motions but grants her motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial. It also addresses motions related to discovery, surplusage, multiplicity, and grand jury challenges, setting deadlines for further negotiations and submissions.",

    "The court ruled that Jeffrey Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement does NOT bar the prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell in the Southern District of New York, as it only binds the Florida district and does not cover the offenses (1994-1997) she is charged with.",
    "The court granted Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts, meaning they will be tried separately.",
    "The court found the Mann Act charges timely under the PROTECT Act's statute of limitations, which allows prosecution for offenses involving sexual abuse of a minor during the victim's lifetime.",
    "The court denied Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment based on the NPA, statute of limitations, vagueness, and other grounds, but denied as moot a motion related to the grand jury location due to a superseding indictment.",
    "The document references a DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility report that found the Epstein NPA was 'unusual,' reflected 'poor judgment,' and its co-conspirator provision was a 'stark departure from normal practice.'",
    "The court ruled that the statute of limitations (18 U.S.C. § 3283, as amended by the 2003 PROTECT Act) applies to Maxwell's alleged offenses, allowing prosecution during the life of the child victims, even for conduct predating the Act's enactment.",
    "The court rejected Maxwell's due process claim based on pre-indictment delay, finding she failed to show the government intentionally delayed for an improper purpose or that the delay (including deaths of witnesses like Epstein) seriously prejudiced her defense.",
    "The court upheld the specificity of the S1 superseding indictment, finding it adequately described the time, place, and nature of the charges (including Mann Act counts) without needing to name the alleged victims.",
    "The court found the perjury charges based on Maxwell's civil deposition answers to be legally tenable, rejecting arguments that the questions were fundamentally ambiguous or immaterial, leaving these issues for the jury.",
    "The court granted Ghislaine Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts, ordering them to be tried separately to ensure a fair trial and protect her right to counsel.",
    "The court denied Maxwell's motion to dismiss the indictment based on Jeffrey Epstein's non-prosecution agreement, statute of limitations, pre-indictment delay, and lack of specificity.",
    "The court found the perjury charges legally tenable, ruling that factual disputes about materiality should be resolved by a jury.",
    "The court denied as premature Maxwell's motions to strike surplusage from the indictment and to dismiss multiplicitous charges.",
    "The court ordered the parties to negotiate a schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures, including Brady/Giglio material, Jencks Act material, and witness lists, aiming for production 6-8 weeks before trial."
