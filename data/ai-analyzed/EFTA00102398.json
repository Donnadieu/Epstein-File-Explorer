  "summary": "This document is an email chain from July 2020 discussing the maximum potential sentence Ghislaine Maxwell faced following her arrest. It includes a forwarded question about why she faced up to 35 years instead of life for a charge under 18 U.S. Code § 2423, and an explanation that the sentencing maximums are based on the law at the time of the alleged offenses (1994-1997). The chain also references a press conference announcing her charges.",
