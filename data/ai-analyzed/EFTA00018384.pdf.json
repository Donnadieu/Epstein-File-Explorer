    "Judge Richard M. Berman denied Jeffrey Epstein bail, deeming him a flight risk and a danger to teenage girls who he believed had an 'uncontrollable' sexual fixation with minors.",
    "Epstein had offered an enormous bond secured by his $56 million Manhattan mansion and private jet, with total assets valued around $559 million.",
    "Authorities found an expired Austrian passport in Epstein's safe with his photo but another person's name, which prosecutors argued showed he knew how to obtain false documents.",
    "The judge cited evidence that Epstein might intimidate or buy off witnesses, including a $350,000 wire transfer after the Miami Herald exposé and a 2006 police report about threats to an accuser.",
    "The bail decision contrasted sharply with Epstein's 2007 Florida plea deal, where he served only 13 months with work release privileges."
