    "Ghislaine Maxwell sought court authorization to subpoena the law firm Boies, Schiller and Flexner LLP (BSF) for twelve categories of documents.",
    "The court denied authorization for Requests 1-8 and 12, finding them overbroad, lacking specificity, seeking materials for improper discovery or premature impeachment, or procurable from the government.",
    "The court reserved judgment on Requests 9-11, ordering the government to provide its views on their propriety within one week.",
    "The court denied the government's blanket request for notice of all future subpoena applications, noting ex parte applications can be justified in some circumstances.",
    "The document reveals Maxwell's defense strategy involved seeking communications between BSF and government officials, as well as fee agreements with alleged victim clients, to support theories of government coordination and witness bias."
