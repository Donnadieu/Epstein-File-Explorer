    "Ghislaine Maxwell proactively called an old school acquaintance, Guy Louthan, in 2016 to inquire if a mutual friend was 'involved with Epstein' or an investigation, suggesting she was monitoring potential witnesses or victims.",
    "A woman acquainted with both Louthan and Maxwell (referred to but not named in the document) exhibited extreme distress (turning white, stammering) when the names of Maxwell or Epstein were mentioned, indicating traumatic association.",
    "Louthan believed the reason for Maxwell's unusual 2016 call was that 'Epstein was in trouble again', showing awareness of Epstein's recurring legal issues.",
    "The interview reveals Maxwell's pattern of reaching out to peripheral social contacts, possibly to gather information or influence potential witnesses years after Epstein's initial legal troubles."
