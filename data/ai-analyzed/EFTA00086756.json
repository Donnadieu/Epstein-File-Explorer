    "The disparities are attributed to Maxwell's unique protective custody housing at MDC versus Rivera's general population housing at MCC, and the greater volume of discovery in Maxwell's case.",
    "Judge Engelmayer raised concerns the disparity had 'terrible' optics and could be perceived as based on race, gender, or class, prompting a formal BOP explanation.",
    "By the date of the email, the MCC had begun leaving a laptop with Rivera all day, ostensibly matching Maxwell's level of electronic discovery access.",
