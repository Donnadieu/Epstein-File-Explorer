    "Ghislaine Maxwell, detained at MDC in protective custody, had access to a laptop for 13 hours per day/7 days a week and 15 hours of weekly video counsel visits, while Justin Rivera at MCC in general population initially had only 3 hours of daily laptop access and 6 hours of weekly video visits.",
    "Judge Engelmayer ordered the U.S. Attorney's Office to provide a declaration explaining the rationale for the disparities in accommodations, citing concerns about optics and potential discrimination based on race, gender, and class.",
    "The disparities were attributed to Maxwell's unique housing situation (protective custody with sole access to a room), the larger volume of discovery in her case, and facility differences between MDC and MCC.",
    "By the time of the email, the MCC had begun providing Rivera with all-day laptop access, matching Maxwell's electronic discovery access, but video conference access remained limited due to shared facility resources."
