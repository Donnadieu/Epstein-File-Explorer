    "The witness described a breakdown in the chain of command regarding the cellmate requirement: if the operations lieutenant did not disseminate the information, line staff would not know, and it was not their responsibility to know.",
    "The interview examines discrepancies in inmate count sheets for the SHU between the 4pm, 10pm, and midnight counts on August 9-10, 2019, suggesting possible improvised documentation or ghost counting.",
    "The witness stated that in her opinion, honest mistakes were made by certain individuals regarding counts, rounds, and the cellmate requirement, and that counting inmates is the primary duty of correctional officers."
