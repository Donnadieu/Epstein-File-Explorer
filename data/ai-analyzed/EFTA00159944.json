  "summary": "This is a peer-reviewed academic research article from Psychological Science (March 2003) titled 'A Prospective Study of Memory for Child Sexual Abuse: New Findings Relevant to the Repressed-Memory Controversy.' It presents a longitudinal study of 175 individuals with documented child sexual abuse (CSA) histories, finding that 81.1% disclosed the documented abuse approximately 13 years later, a higher rate than previous seminal studies. The study examines predictors of disclosure, including age, abuse severity, maternal support, and legal involvement. This is an academic research article titled 'Remembering Abuse' published in Psychological Science, reporting on a study of long-term memory for documented childhood sexual abuse (CSA). The study examines predictors of disclosure/non-disclosure of abuse among a prosecution sample, finding that forgetting CSA is not common, with factors like abuse severity, age at abuse, and maternal support influencing disclosure rates.",

    "The study found 81.1% of participants with documented CSA disclosed the abuse approximately 13 years later, a much higher rate than the 38% non-disclosure rate found in Linda Williams's 1994 seminal study.",
    "Predictors of increased likelihood of disclosure included older age when the abuse ended, maternal support following disclosure, and more severe abuse.",
    "The study argues that failure to report documented CSA should not automatically be interpreted as evidence of memory inaccessibility (repression), though it does not rule it out in a subset of cases.",
    "The research involved 175 participants from an original pool of 217 children involved in criminal prosecutions for CSA between 1985-1987, providing strong documented cases for comparison.",
    "The article is part of the academic 'repressed-memory controversy,' debating whether special memory mechanisms like repression explain forgetting of trauma or if normal memory processes are sufficient.",
    "The document is a peer-reviewed academic study on memory for childhood sexual abuse (CSA), not a direct legal document from the Epstein case.",
    "The study's key finding is that 'forgetting of CSA may not be a common experience, at least not in a prosecution sample,' contradicting some theories about repressed memory.",
    "Factors positively associated with disclosure of abuse included abuse severity, the abuse ending after age 5, and receiving maternal support after initial disclosure.",
    "The study found a significant difference in disclosure rates by ethnicity: 87.6% for Caucasian non-Hispanics vs. 70.0% for African Americans.",
    "The role of dissociation was noted as deserving further study, as more dissociative individuals were less likely to disclose abuse."
