  "keyFacts": [
    "Prosecutors were actively drafting an indictment against Jeffrey Epstein in June 2019.",
    "There was internal debate about whether to charge a single count covering all conduct or separate counts per victim, with a preference for the former to avoid suggesting the case was narrow.",
    "Prosecutors acknowledged the need to 'bulk up' the indictment to instill public confidence in the case's significance, referencing 'the prior history' (likely Epstein's 2008 plea deal).",
    "A key concern was balancing the need for a robust public case with protecting victim anonymity and preserving investigative details.",
    "The correspondence shows coordination for a planned press conference, indicating the indictment's imminent public release."
