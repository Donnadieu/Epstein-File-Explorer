    "The document reveals an active U.S. investigation into Epstein-related sex crimes as of January 2020, focusing on transportation of minors for illicit sexual conduct under 18 U.S.C. 2423.",
    "Prosecutors sought to interview a witness in Sweden who was described as not a conspirator or 'bad actor' and where no victims were believed to be Swedish residents.",
    "The investigation was described as 'extraordinarily sensitive,' leading prosecutors to avoid MLAT requests where possible to limit information sharing with foreign governments.",
    "Swedish law enforcement required prosecutor involvement for the interview, triggering the need for an MLAT request despite the interview being voluntary.",
    "The email chain shows coordination issues between the FBI Legat and Swedish authorities regarding interview approval procedures."
