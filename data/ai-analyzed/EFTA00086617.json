  "summary": "This document is a series of emails from whistleblower Christopher J. Dilorio to various judges and SEC officials, alleging massive ongoing securities fraud, accounting fraud, and money laundering involving Virtu Financial (VIRT/NITE), Knight Capital (KCG), and their associates. Dilorio claims the SEC and SDNY are engaged in criminal obstruction to protect these entities and individuals like Rich Handler of Jefferies, while denying his whistleblower claims and covering up the true nature of their business: abusive naked short selling of OTC market shells to facilitate money laundering.",
