    "The chief psychologist conducted three suicide risk assessments on Jeffrey Epstein during his incarceration: upon intake (July 8), after the July 23 incident, and once after a court return (likely August 1).",

    "Dr. [REDACTED] had three hypotheses about the July 23 incident: 1) It was 'gamey' (manipulative) by Epstein or Tartaglione, 2) It was a rehearsal for suicide by Epstein, or 3) It was a real assault by Tartaglione. She believed all were equally plausible at the time.",

    "Dr. [REDACTED] believes Epstein died by suicide, citing factors like receiving devastating legal news, feeling hopeless, and being left alone in his cell without a cellmate."
