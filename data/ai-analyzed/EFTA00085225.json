  "summary": "This is a 2021 opinion and order by Judge Alison J. Nathan in the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal case, resolving several of Maxwell's pretrial motions. The court denies Maxwell's motions to dismiss based on Epstein's non-prosecution agreement and statute of limitations, but grants her motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. The opinion deals exclusively with the first superseding indictment (S1). This is a court opinion and order (Document 207) from Judge Alison J. Nathan in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell (1:20-cr-00330-AJN). The document addresses Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment, including arguments regarding the statute of limitations, pre-indictment delay, specificity of charges, and perjury counts. The court denies Maxwell's motions, finding the statute of limitations does not bar prosecution, due process was not violated, the indictment is sufficiently specific, and the perjury charges are legally tenable. This is a court opinion and order (Document 207) from Judge Alison J. Nathan in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell (1:20-cr-00330). The court denies most of Maxwell's pretrial motions but grants her motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial. It also addresses motions to dismiss, strike surplusage, and compel discovery, setting deadlines for the parties to negotiate a pretrial disclosure schedule.",

    "The court ruled that Jeffrey Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement (NPA) with the Southern District of Florida does not bar the prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell in the Southern District of New York, as it does not bind other districts and does not cover the offenses charged (which occurred from 1994-1997).",
    "The court denied Maxwell's motion to dismiss the charges as untimely, holding that the extended statute of limitations under the PROTECT Act (allowing prosecution during the victim's lifetime) applies to the Mann Act charges as they 'involve' the sexual abuse of minors.",
    "The court granted Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts, ordering that they be tried separately.",
    "The opinion references a Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) report that found Epstein's NPA was 'unusual,' reflected 'poor judgment,' and that the co-conspirator provision was a 'stark departure from normal practice.'",
    "The motions addressed in this opinion pertain only to the first superseding indictment (S1); a second superseding indictment (S2) had already been returned adding sex trafficking charges, which are not resolved here.",
    "The court ruled that the statute of limitations (18 U.S.C. § 3283, as amended by the 2003 PROTECT Act) does not bar the prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell for offenses involving the sexual abuse of a minor, even for conduct that occurred before the Act's enactment, as long as the statute of limitations had not expired at the time of enactment.",
    "The court rejected Maxwell's due process claim regarding pre-indictment delay, finding she failed to show the government intentionally delayed for an improper purpose or that the delay seriously prejudiced her defense, despite the deaths of potential witnesses like Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "The court found the S1 superseding indictment was sufficiently specific under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7, rejecting Maxwell's arguments that it was vague for using approximate time periods, describing 'grooming' conduct, and not naming the alleged victims.",
    "The court denied Maxwell's motion to dismiss the perjury counts, finding the questions in her civil deposition were not 'fundamentally ambiguous' and that a reasonable juror could conclude her false statements were material to the proceeding.",
    "The document reveals Maxwell's defense strategy included arguing that pretrial publicity and alleged victim collusion based on media reports prejudiced her case, claims the court found unsupported by evidence.",
    "The court granted Ghislaine Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts for separate trials, citing risks of unfair prejudice and potential disqualification of her chosen counsel.",
    "The court denied Maxwell's motion to dismiss the indictment based on Jeffrey Epstein's non-prosecution agreement, statute of limitations, pre-indictment delay, and lack of specificity.",
    "The court found the perjury charges legally tenable, ruling that factual disputes about materiality should be resolved by a jury.",
    "The court denied as premature Maxwell's motions to strike surplusage from the indictment and to dismiss counts as multiplicitous.",
    "The court ordered the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all outstanding pretrial disclosures, including Brady/Giglio material and witness lists, aiming for production 6-8 weeks before trial."
