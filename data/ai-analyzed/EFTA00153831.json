  "keyFacts": [
    "The FBI Victim Services Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York were coordinating in July 2020 to determine which victims of Jeffrey Epstein had received official notification letters regarding case events and eligibility for services.",
    "Attorney Brittany Henderson, representing multiple victims, provided lists of clients to the FBI, separating those who had misplaced notification letters from those who needed interviews.",
    "The email chain references the 2007 Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) as a source for identifying some victims.",
    "A key point of confusion was that, per a VSD Notification Report, only one person was recorded as having received a notification, which the sender found alarming and potentially incorrect.",
    "The correspondence indicates the investigation was still considered open as of July 2020, with victim notification procedures being carefully managed by prosecutors."
