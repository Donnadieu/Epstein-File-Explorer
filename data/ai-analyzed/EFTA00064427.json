  "keyFacts": [
    "The camera recording system in the MCC's SHU was not working on August 9-10, 2019, during the time of Jeffrey Epstein's death. Only one camera in the SHU was reportedly recording.",
    "The system failure was attributed to old, antiquated equipment where multiple hard drives failed. A camera replacement project had been initiated in 2018 but was not yet completed.",
    "The facilities manager was on vacation during the incident and stated he was not notified about the camera failure at the time. He learned of it upon his return.",
    "Access to the physical camera system was controlled by the SIS (Special Investigative Supervisor) office. Only certain personnel (Comtechs and possibly computer services) had the administrative rights to take cameras offline via the software.",
    "The interview reveals institutional knowledge of the outdated camera system and chronic understaffing, with only one Comtech employed at the time of the incident."
