  "summary": "This document is a legal opinion prepared by French attorney William Julie regarding French extradition law, specifically addressing whether Ghislaine Maxwell could be extradited from France to the United States if she fled there while on bail. The opinion concludes that French law and the US-France extradition treaty do not prohibit the extradition of French nationals, and it is highly unlikely France would refuse extradition in Maxwell's case given her US citizenship, signed waiver, and diplomatic considerations. The document includes the opinion, the attorney's resume, and Maxwell's signed extradition waiver.",

    "Ghislaine Maxwell signed an irrevocable waiver of her right to contest extradition from France to the US, which her legal team argued would make extradition highly likely if she fled to France.",
    "The opinion states that if Maxwell fled to France after violating bail, she would likely be placed in custody there during extradition proceedings, and the overall process could be completed expediently (within weeks).",
    "The document reveals that Maxwell's French nationality and international ties were cited by the US court as grounds for denying her bail, due to perceived flight risk.",
    "The opinion notes there is no precedent for the US seeking extradition of a dual French-US citizen from France, but argues diplomatic and practical factors would strongly favor extradition in Maxwell's unique case."
