    "Each page contains SDNY document identifiers (e.g., SDNY_GM_02753423 through SDNY_GM_02753429) and EFTA reference numbers (EFTA00102221 through EFTA00102227).",
    "The text is largely unreadable due to garbled characters and placeholder text, suggesting these are cover sheets or metadata pages rather than substantive content.",
