  "summary": "This is a legal memorandum filed by the Government of the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) seeking to intervene in the civil case Giuffre v. Maxwell. The USVI requests confidential access to sealed summary judgment documents and unfiled discovery materials to aid its separate civil enforcement action under the Virgin Islands Criminally Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (CICO) against the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein and related entities. This is a legal motion filed by the Government of the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) seeking to intervene in a civil case and modify a protective order. The USVI argues it needs confidential access to unfiled discovery deposition documents and exhibits from the civil action to aid its own law enforcement action against Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking conduct, especially since Epstein's death makes his direct testimony unavailable.",
