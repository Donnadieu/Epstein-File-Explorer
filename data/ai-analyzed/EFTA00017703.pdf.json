    "Ghislaine Maxwell, in her 2016 deposition, testified she was not aware of any scheme by Jeffrey Epstein to recruit underage girls for sexual massages.",

    "Maxwell denied being aware of the presence of sex toys in Epstein's Palm Beach house and denied ever giving anyone, including Epstein and 'Minor Victim-2', a massage.",

    "The flight dates requested for slides (e.g., November 11, 1996; May 9, 1997) suggest these were dates of interest for travel possibly related to the case."
