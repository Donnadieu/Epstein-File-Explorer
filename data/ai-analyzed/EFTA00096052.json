    "Prosecutors explicitly state a strategy to keep victim details sparse in the indictment to protect victim anonymity and to preserve the ability to vet new witnesses later.",
    "There is internal pressure to 'bulk up' the indictment to instill public confidence in the case's seriousness, referencing 'the prior history' (likely Epstein's 2008 plea deal).",
    "The arrest by the SDNY is seen as a key event that will itself communicate the case's significance.",
    "Proposed additions to the indictment include paragraphs on the volume of victims, search warrant evidence, and the financial vulnerability of some victims.",
    "The correspondence reveals prosecutorial concern about public perception and the need for a press conference strategy."
