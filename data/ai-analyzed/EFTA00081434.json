    "The document details an internal U.S. Attorney's Office (SDNY) process in late 2020 for reviewing data from multiple Jeffrey Epstein devices (phones/iPads coded 1B71, 1B72, 1869, 1884, 1883, 1867, 1868) for privilege and responsiveness.",
    "Significant volumes of potentially privileged (PP) material were withheld: 1107 emails from one device, 169 PP emails and one PP chat (with Darren Indyke) from another, and 93 PP emails from a third.",
    "The review was under a tight deadline, with a need to finish responsiveness tagging by November 5, 2020, to prepare for a November 9, 2020, production deadline.",
    "The correspondence reveals logistical and technical challenges in handling the large data sets, including network issues and the need to copy files to local drives to avoid crashing the office network."
