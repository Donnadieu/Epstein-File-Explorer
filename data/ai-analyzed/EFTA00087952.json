    "Prosecutors are actively coordinating to oppose the unsealing of a defense motion, citing a protective order entered less than a month prior.",
    "The drafting prosecutor suggests a strategy of abstraction, avoiding detailed fights over whether materials might affect civil cases, as they believe Judge Nathan may not be well-positioned to evaluate those intricacies.",
