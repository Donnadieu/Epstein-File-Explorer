  "keyFacts": [
    "The camera recording system at the MCC experienced multiple failures: a system failure on July 29, 2019, a motherboard failure on August 8, 2019, and a hard drive failure on August 10, 2019.",
    "On August 10, 2019, the BOP employee replaced two failed hard drives, an action that risked corrupting the video database and wiping all prior recorded data. The FBI was present during this activity.",
    "The interview reveals potential inconsistencies, as the employee is questioned about previously stating they first learned of the camera issue on August 9, 2019, while evidence suggests they knew on August 8.",
    "A similar 'Raid just crashed' system failure had occurred in February 2019, raising questions about whether corrective measures were taken to prevent the August 2019 failure.",
    "The Warden wanted video preserved, but the technical process of replacing the drives to fix the system carried the risk of destroying the existing footage."
