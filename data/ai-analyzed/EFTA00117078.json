    "Procedural details are examined for two inmates: Efrain Reyes (transferred out) and Fernandez (moved to a dry cell after a contraband incident).",
    "A key finding is that the call-out list for the SHU, which would show inmate movements, is not retained; it is created in the Sentry system, deleted daily, and likely not stored beyond 45 days.",
    "The interview reveals potential procedural failures, such as the delayed system update for inmate Fernandez's location, which could lead to 'bad counts' and security issues.",
    "The BOP employee explains the chit system for key accountability and confirms that no one can access the SHU with a key alone; all access is controlled by the control center."
