    "U.S. Attorney Acosta expresses frustration over delays in Epstein's guilty plea, revealing prosecutors had asked him to declare the Non-Prosecution Agreement in breach weeks earlier.",
    "Acosta states the DOJ will not be party to an agreement where Epstein pleads guilty to an offense he believes he did not commit, directly referencing concerns raised by Professor Dershowitz about Florida Statute 796.03.",
    "The letter proposes revised language for the agreement's Section 2255 provisions, aiming to place victims in the same position as if Epstein had been convicted at trial, and mentions providing Epstein's attorneys a list of individuals the USAO was prepared to name as victims in an indictment.",
    "Acosta reveals he contacted Assistant Attorney General Fisher to preemptively seek an expedited review in case of a defense appeal, specifically to try to preserve the January 4, 2008 plea date.",
    "The document confirms the Non-Prosecution Agreement was intended as a 'global resolution' of Epstein's state and federal criminal liability, contingent on a guilty plea to a registerable state offense with a binding prison recommendation."
