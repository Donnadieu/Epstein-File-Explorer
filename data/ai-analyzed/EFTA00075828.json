    "Investigators were actively working to recover surveillance video from two DVR systems (DVR 1 and DVR 2) seized in the Epstein case (90A-NY-3151227) in August-September 2019.",
    "DVR System 2 experienced a disk failure on July 29, 2019, halting video recording. Technicians were attempting to manually rebuild data from its 16-disk array, which had lost its configuration.",
    "The potential video coverage from both systems combined spanned a critical 14-day window from approximately July 15 to August 15, 2019.",
    "Access to DVR System 1 was partially achieved, but a password was needed for the main controller (Dell PowerEdge R420) to gain full visibility into its stored video.",
    "The correspondence involves a CART (Computer Analysis and Response Team) Examiner at Quantico and other law enforcement technicians, indicating a focused digital evidence recovery effort shortly after Epstein's death in August 2019."
