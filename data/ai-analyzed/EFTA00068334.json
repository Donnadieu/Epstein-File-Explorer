    "The government had failed to provide a complete, readable set of discovery materials to Ghislaine Maxwell over five weeks past the court-ordered August 21, 2020 deadline.",

    "COVID-19 restrictions prevented the U.S. Marshals from producing pretrial detainees to proffer rooms, complicating Maxwell's access to Highly Confidential documents.",
    "The defense team had catalogued defects in prior productions and spent hours trying to correct government errors, while Maxwell had lost over a month of review time.",
    "The letter marks the government's third attempt to produce a readable set of discovery, with the defense having little confidence it would fix the errors."
