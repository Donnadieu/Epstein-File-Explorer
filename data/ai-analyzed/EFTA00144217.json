    "The victim describes a systematic pattern of manipulation where Epstein and Maxwell exploited her vulnerabilities (damaged upbringing, visa status, educational desires) to ensnare and control her.",
    "Epstein and Maxwell used a 'no-win' situation to demoralize the victim, criticizing her FIT application and putting her on a strict diet while simultaneously having a psychiatrist prescribe drugs that caused weight gain.",
    "The victim was repeatedly raped by Epstein and lived under threats that if she ever fled, she would be found and her family would be killed—threats reinforced by Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "The escape in 2007 did not end the fear; the victim cites evidence of Epstein attempting to find her in 2017 and suffers from severe, diagnosed PTSD, anxiety, depression, and hypervigilance.",
    "The victim states that the trauma has fundamentally altered her life, preventing her from realizing her professional potential, entering healthy relationships, or having children."
