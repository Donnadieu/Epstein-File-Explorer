    "The Bureau of Prisons was experiencing severe staffing shortages at MDC Brooklyn and MCC New York, with vacancy rates of 12.12% and 15.5% respectively in the period covered.",
    "From 2016-2018, MDC Brooklyn and MCC New York had very low selection rates from applicant pools (e.g., only 12 out of 82 applicants selected in FY2018).",
    "Exit surveys indicated staff left due to the urban location and non-competitive salaries compared to other NYC law enforcement agencies.",
    "The memorandum requests a 10% group retention incentive and a 25% recruitment/relocation incentive to address the staffing crisis.",
    "FCI Otisville, a lower-security facility in a rural setting 62 miles away, offered the same salary, making it more attractive to staff."
