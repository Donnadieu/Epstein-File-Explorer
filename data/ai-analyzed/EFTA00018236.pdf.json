    "The Government has produced over 2.7 million pages of discovery to Ghislaine Maxwell's defense.",
    "The Government is opposing Maxwell's attempt to subpoena records from the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (BSF), arguing it is an improper 'fishing expedition' for impeachment material, not for admissible evidence.",
    "The Government's letter reveals the BSF subpoena seeks sensitive victim information, including the 'original, complete copy' of a victim's diary.",
    "The Government requests the court to order Maxwell's defense to provide notice of all Rule 17(c) subpoena applications and to share any obtained materials with the prosecution.",
    "The legal argument centers on the strict standards from United States v. Nixon, which limit Rule 17(c) subpoenas to obtaining specific, admissible evidence for trial, not for general discovery."
