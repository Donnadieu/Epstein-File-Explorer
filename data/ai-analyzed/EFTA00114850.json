    "The interviewed officer, who worked in both custody and R&D, stated that if staff knew an inmate was WAB (With All Belongings) and not returning, and knew Epstein required a cellmate, they should have taken action to assign a new cellmate.",
    "There were significant count discrepancies in the SHU on the night of August 9-10, 2019, because inmate Fernandez was moved to a dry cell in R&D but not keyed out of the SHU, leading to incorrect counts at 4:00 p.m., 10:00 p.m., and midnight.",
    "The officer expressed that institutional problems included a lack of training, poor communication, and low morale, and that staff often follow incorrect practices because they are not properly trained.",
    "The officer believed Epstein died by suicide, had no knowledge of anyone assisting him or causing his death, and had no reason to believe cameras were intentionally knocked offline."
