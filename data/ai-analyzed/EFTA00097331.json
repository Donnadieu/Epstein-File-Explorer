The motion argues the government violated Maxwell's Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and due process rights by obtaining 90,000 pages of confidential material without proper notice and through misleading the court. It seeks suppression of all evidence from the subpoena and dismissal of Counts Five and Six (perjury counts) of her indictment.",
