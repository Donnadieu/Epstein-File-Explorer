  "summary": "This is a declaration by Russell Capone, Counsel to the Acting U.S. Attorney for the SDNY, filed in support of the Bureau of Prisons' motion for summary judgment in a FOIA lawsuit brought by The New York Times. The declaration argues for withholding records related to Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration and death at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, citing exemptions to prevent interference with the pending prosecutions of correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, and inmate Nicholas Tartaglione. This is a declaration filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in response to a FOIA request, arguing for withholding documents under Exemption 7(A) to avoid interfering with ongoing prosecutions, specifically those of Nicholas Tartaglione and others. It cites risks of influencing potential jurors and contributing to speculation about Jeffrey Epstein's death. This is a federal indictment against correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas for conspiracy and making false records related to their failure to conduct required inmate counts and rounds at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) on August 9-10, 2019. The indictment alleges their dereliction of duty directly preceded the discovery of Jeffrey Epstein's suicide in his cell. This is a superseding indictment from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Nicholas Tartaglione. It charges him with 15 counts related to a narcotics conspiracy, four murders, kidnapping, and firearms offenses that occurred in April 2016. The indictment details the killings of Martin Luna, Urbano Santiago, Miguel Luna, and Hector Gutierrez. This document is a superseding indictment from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Nicholas Tartaglione. It details multiple counts related to a drug trafficking enterprise, including murder, kidnapping resulting in death, and travel act violations, specifically concerning the killings of Martin Luna, Urbano Santiago, Miguel Luna, and Hector Gutierrez on or about April 11, 2016.",
