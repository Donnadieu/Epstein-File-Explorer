  "summary": "This is a letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York to Judge Richard M. Berman, opposing Jeffrey Epstein's motion for pretrial release. The government argues Epstein is a flight risk and danger to the community, detailing his vast wealth, history of witness manipulation, possession of nude images of young females, and the strength of the evidence against him. It requests the court order him detained pending trial. This is a government memorandum filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office opposing Jeffrey Epstein's motion for bail. It argues that Epstein is a severe flight risk and danger to the community, detailing why home confinement, electronic monitoring, and private security are inadequate. It also cites evidence of witness intimidation, recent suspicious payments to co-conspirators, and Epstein's possession of photographic 'trophies' of victims. This is a government letter filed in the Southern District of New York opposing bail for Jeffrey Epstein. It argues for pretrial detention based on extreme flight risk and danger to the community, citing his wealth, international travel, past witness interference, and the serious charges of sex trafficking of dozens of minors. This is a government memorandum in support of pretrial detention for Jeffrey Epstein, filed in the Southern District of New York. It argues Epstein is a severe flight risk and danger to the community, detailing his vast wealth, international travel, prior conviction, and alleged witness tampering. Attached are excerpts from Palm Beach Police Department incident reports from 2006 detailing witness intimidation.",
