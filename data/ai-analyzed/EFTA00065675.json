  "summary": "This document is a legal opinion prepared by French attorney William Julie for Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team, analyzing French extradition law. It concludes that France can extradite its nationals to the US under the existing treaty, and that Maxwell's planned waiver and flight risk make her extradition likely if she flees to France. The opinion was used in her US bail proceedings to counter the government's claim that France would not extradite her.",

    "The legal opinion concludes that France can legally extradite its own nationals to the United States under the 1996 Extradition Treaty, which contains no prohibition, contrary to the US government's claim at Maxwell's bail hearing.",
    "Ghislaine Maxwell planned to execute an 'irrevocable waiver' of her right to contest extradition from France to the US, a key strategic move to support her bail application by mitigating flight risk concerns.",
    "The opinion argues that if Maxwell fled to France after violating bail, French courts would likely keep her in custody and the French government would be highly likely to issue an extradition decree, citing diplomatic relations and the lack of legal bars.",
    "The document includes Maxwell's signed affidavit and waiver of extraition (Exhibit B), sworn before Judge Alison J. Nathan, consenting to extradition under the relevant treaties.",
    "The analysis finds that the crimes Maxwell is charged with in the US (conspiracy to entice minors, etc.) would qualify as the crime of 'proxénétisme' under French law, satisfying the dual criminality requirement for extradition."
