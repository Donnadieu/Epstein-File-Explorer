    "It states Jeffrey Epstein had already pleaded guilty to state charges (solicitation of minors for prostitution) on June 30, 2008.",
    "The document alleges the victim (Jane Doe) was lured to Epstein's mansion under false pretenses for a massage, where he then demanded sexual acts in exchange for payment.",
    "It cites the Fifth Circuit case 'In re Dean' (2008) which held the government violated the CVRA by negotiating a plea agreement without conferring with victims.",
    "The petition argues CVRA rights apply during the investigation phase, before any charges are formally filed."
