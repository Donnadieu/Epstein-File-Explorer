  "summary": "This is a declaration by Russell Capone, an Assistant United States Attorney, filed in support of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' motion for summary judgment in a FOIA lawsuit brought by The New York Times. The declaration argues for withholding records related to Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration and death at the Metropolitan Correctional Center under FOIA Exemption 7(A), citing potential interference with the pending prosecutions of correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, and inmate Nicholas Tartaglione. This document is a declaration filed in court arguing for the withholding of certain records under FOIA Exemption 7(A), citing that their release would interfere with the ongoing prosecutions of individuals including Tartaglione, Noel, and Thomas, particularly by publicizing associations with Jeffrey Epstein and risking jury impartiality.",
