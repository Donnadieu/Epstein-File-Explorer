  "summary": "This is a declaration by Russell Capone, an Assistant United States Attorney, filed in support of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' motion for summary judgment in a FOIA lawsuit brought by The New York Times. The declaration argues for withholding records related to Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration and death at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, citing exemptions to prevent interference with the pending prosecutions of correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, and inmate Nicholas Tartaglione. This document is a declaration filed in court arguing for withholding certain records under FOIA Exemption 7(A) to avoid interfering with ongoing prosecutions, specifically mentioning the Tartaglione case and its connection to Epstein. It discusses risks of publicizing associations between Tartaglione and Epstein and potential jury influence.",
