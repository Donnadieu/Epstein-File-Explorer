  "keyFacts": [
    "Ghislaine Maxwell testified in April 2019 that she is a U.S. citizen (since the mid-1990s) and also a citizen of France and England.",
    "Maxwell stated she ran a company called Ellmax LLC, which she used to advise businesses and cover travel costs, and that lawyer Darren Indyke helped create it.",
    "She claimed to have worked 60 hours a week for the Terramar Project, a not-for-profit entity, but said she and other board members received no compensation.",
    "Maxwell testified she had a personal assistant for over ten years (starting around 2001-2002) whom she paid personally, not through Ellmax.",
    "The deposition was taken in a civil slip and fall case, and the document's forwarding in 2020 suggests legal teams were circulating it for potential relevance to other matters."
