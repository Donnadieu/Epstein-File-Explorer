  "summary": "This is a court order by Judge Alison J. Nathan granting a short continuance of Ghislaine Maxwell's trial from July 2021 to fall 2021. The continuance is granted due to the government's late filing of a superseding indictment (S2) which added new charges and an alleged victim, requiring additional defense preparation time. The order balances the defense's need to prepare against the interests of a speedy trial.",

    "The S2 Superseding Indictment added significant new charges against Ghislaine Maxwell, including a sex trafficking conspiracy (2001-2004) and sex trafficking of a minor (Counts 5 & 6).",

    "Judge Alison J. Nathan granted a continuance of the trial from July 2021 to fall 2021, rejecting both the defense's request for a January 2022 date and the government's proposal for March 2022.",

    "The order emphasizes the need to balance the defense's preparation time against the defendant's pre-trial detention status and the public/victims' interest in a trial without undue delay."
