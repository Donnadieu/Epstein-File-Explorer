    "The MCC's camera system in the SHU was antiquated and not recording during the critical period. A new system had been purchased but was not installed due to manpower and funding issues.",
    "The warden believed staff at all levels (SHU officers, lieutenants, captain) shared responsibility for the failure to ensure Epstein had a cellmate and for not conducting proper rounds and counts.",
    "An unmonitored phone call was provided to Epstein on August 9 on a legal line; he said he was calling his deceased mother, a man answered, and the call was not properly monitored by staff."
