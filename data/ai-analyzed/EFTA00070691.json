    "The whistleblower, Christopher J. DiIorio, alleges a massive, ongoing criminal obstruction scheme by the SEC to protect Knight Capital/KCG/Virtu Financial (NITE) and its associates like Handler (Jefferies) and Cifu from allegations of abusive naked short selling and money laundering.",
    "DiIorio claims the SEC, Handler, and Cifu orchestrated the 2017 Virtu/KCG merger using fraudulently inflated assets, writing down over $4 billion in 'naked short fails' just before the deal closed to hide KCG's insolvency.",
    "The document asserts that the core, illegal business of NITE/Virtu is 'abusive naked shorting' of OTC market shells to facilitate money laundering, a practice the SEC has knowingly facilitated and covered up since at least the 2012 Knight 'glitch'.",
    "DiIorio accuses SEC Chairman Jay Clayton of failing to recuse himself despite conflicts of interest stemming from his former firm Sullivan & Cromwell's ties to NITE/Virtu, and alleges his colleague Jared Fishman played a key role in the scheme.",
    "The email details how the SEC allegedly used DiIorio's whistleblower information to bring selective enforcement actions (e.g., against Sason, Keener, SeeThruEquity) while protecting the main entity, NITE/Virtu, and then denied him an award based on a fabricated record."
