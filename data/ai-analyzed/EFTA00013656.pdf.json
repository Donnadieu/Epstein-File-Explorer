    "The state indictment against Epstein involved two girls, one of whom was also in the federal indictment. It charged solicitation of adult prostitution, not a child exploitation offense, despite Florida law not allowing a defense based on the victim's misrepresentation of age.",
    "A proposed non-prosecution agreement required Epstein to: 1) plead to a state offense requiring sex offender registration, 2) agree to an 18-month incarceration term, and 3) agree to pay restitution and damages to victims. After signing, Epstein tried to evade all three requirements.",
    "Epstein was subpoenaing victims for depositions who were not included in the state indictment, which the email author suggests was an attempt to gather information about the federal investigation.",
    "Before federal involvement, local police were told Epstein would plead to a misdemeanor with no jail time, which prompted the FBI to step in.",
    "Epstein's defense counsel had continued the state case repeatedly on the basis that it could not be resolved until the federal case was resolved."
