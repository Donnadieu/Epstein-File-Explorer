Nathan in the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal case, addressing the government's motion to require attorney David Markus to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.1 regarding extrajudicial statements. The order finds that Markus, who has represented Maxwell on bail appeals and presented himself publicly as her attorney, is sufficiently 'associated' with the defense to be bound by the rule, and orders him to comply going forward.",

    "The court found attorney David Markus, who handled bail appeals for Ghislaine Maxwell and presented himself publicly as her counsel, to be sufficiently 'associated' with her defense to be bound by rules limiting extrajudicial statements.",
    "The order clarifies that Local Criminal Rule 23.1 applies to lawyers associated with a case, not just those who have formally filed a notice of appearance.",
    "The court did not discipline Markus for the op-ed in question but issued a clear warning that he and all lawyers associated with the case must comply with the rule going forward to protect the right to a fair trial.",
    "The document references a prior court directive (Dkt. No. 28) that counsel, agents, and counsel for potential witnesses must protect the defendant's right to a fair trial.",
    "Failure to comply with Rule 23.1 could result in attorney discipline and could impact the trial, potentially causing delays or undermining its integrity."
