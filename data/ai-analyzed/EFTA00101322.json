The witness, whose name is not provided in this excerpt, is being cross-examined by multiple plaintiff attorneys about his employment as Epstein's house manager, his knowledge of massage therapists, and a personal incident involving theft from Epstein. This document is a transcript of grand jury testimony from a former employee of Jeffrey Epstein, likely a butler or house manager. The witness describes his duties related to scheduling and escorting massage therapists to Epstein's residence, payment procedures, and observations about the ages and frequency of visitors. The testimony includes objections from a defense attorney and questioning by a prosecutor. This document is a deposition transcript of a former employee of Jeffrey Epstein, likely a butler or house manager. The witness testifies about finding sex toys after massages involving Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his stressful working conditions, and admits to stealing money from Epstein's briefcase after leaving employment. The deposition includes cross-examination about a police investigation into the theft. This document is a transcript of grand jury testimony where a former employee of Jeffrey Epstein is being questioned about his employment, financial dealings, and specific incidents involving Epstein.
