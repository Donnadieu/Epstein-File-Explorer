Keith recounts meeting a young girl on Long Beach Island, NJ, in the summer of 1976-77, who claimed Ghislaine Maxwell was her sister. The narrative describes a brief, unsettling encounter with Jeffrey Epstein, after which the girl appeared afraid. The following day, Maxwell allegedly told Keith the girl had died, then changed the story to say she had run away, after which both nearby houses were quickly vacated.",
