    "The prosecution team received sensitive, non-public trust documents from the Epstein estate trustees that were not even shared with the beneficiaries themselves.",
    "Significant beneficiaries of the Epstein trust include Maxwell, though she is noted to receive a 'relatively smaller amount.' Other potential beneficiaries (names partially redacted as 'or Groff') are noted as not being included.",
    "The trust documents produced include 'The 1953 Trust' (dated August 8, 2019), an 'Amended and Restated' version (February 4, 2019), and the original 'Jeffrey E. Epstein 2019 Trust' (January 18, 2019).",
    "The defense attorney asserts that communications related to the trust formation are privileged and defers production, noting the government may have some relevant information from Epstein's computers.",
    "The prosecution team is handling the documents with extreme caution, keeping them 'within the building' and not immediately emailing them to law enforcement partners to prevent further dissemination."
