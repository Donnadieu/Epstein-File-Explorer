  "keyFacts": [
    "Prosecutors were actively drafting an indictment for Jeffrey Epstein in June 2019, prior to his arrest by the SDNY.",
    "There was significant internal debate about withholding specific victim details to protect their anonymity and preserve the ability to vet future witnesses.",
    "Prosecutors considered adding paragraphs about the volume of victims, search warrant evidence, and victims' financial circumstances to 'bulk up' the indictment.",
    "A key concern was managing public perception and instilling confidence in the case's seriousness, given the 'prior history' (likely a reference to Epstein's 2008 plea deal).",
    "The correspondence shows a strategic focus on controlling information release for both victim protection and prosecutorial advantage."
