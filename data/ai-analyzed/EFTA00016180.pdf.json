    "The FBI was experiencing significant delays (over a month past estimates) in processing the voluminous digital evidence seized from Jeffrey Epstein's properties in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",
    "The evidence from the US Virgin Islands was described as 'vastly more voluminous' than the New York materials and constituted the 'overwhelming majority of the data.'",
    "Prosecutors urgently needed the evidence, particularly old emails from servers, for the case against Ghislaine Maxwell, noting that newer devices were purchased years after she was 'out of the picture.'",
    "Technical challenges included problematic iPhone extractions, difficulties with newer Mac items using the APFS file system, and prior data transfers that were not in a usable, searchable format for the prosecution.",
    "A proposal was made to hire an external vendor, BRG, for $85-135K to process all the data into a Relativity-friendly format within a month, due to the FBI's delays."
