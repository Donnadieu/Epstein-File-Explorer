    "Technical hurdles included missing administrator passwords for the main server controller and a failed disk array on 'DVR 2' that may have been compromised when disks were 'pulled out of the system live'.",
    "The individuals operating the jail's DVRs and servers were described as 'not the most technical operators' and did not know the system passwords.",
    "An external maintenance contractor, Mt SIGNET TECHNOLOGIES, was identified as the person who had been maintaining the MCC's system.",
    "The case reference is 90A-NY-3151227 (Epstein), and the work was being done by an FBI CART (Computer Analysis and Response Team) examiner."
