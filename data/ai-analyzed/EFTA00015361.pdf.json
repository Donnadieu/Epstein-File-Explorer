  "summary": "This is a declaration by BOP Government Information Specialist Kara Christenson filed in the FOIA lawsuit 'The New York Times Company v. Federal Bureau of Prisons'. It details the BOP's search for and processing of records responsive to the Times' FOIA requests concerning Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration and death at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC). The declaration describes the specific records sought, the search methodologies, and the BOP's responses, including records released, withheld, or not in BOP possession. This document is a court filing (likely a declaration) from a FOIA lawsuit concerning Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration and death. It details the Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) search for records related to Epstein's suicide watch, suicide, communications, and investigations, and explains the legal exemptions used to withhold many of the responsive documents. This document is part of a court filing (likely a Vaughn index or declaration) from the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in response to a FOIA lawsuit. It details the legal justifications for withholding records related to Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration and death at MCC New York under various FOIA exemptions (5, 6, 7(C), 7(E), 7(F)). It includes an attachment showing the original FOIA request from a New York Times reporter. This document is part of a court filing (Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE) and contains attachments consisting of FOIA requests and responses related to Jeffrey Epstein's death in custody. It includes a reporter's requests to the Bureau of Prisons for records on Epstein's suicide, prison conditions, and communications, followed by the BOP's denial citing multiple FOIA exemptions and a subsequent appeal denial by the DOJ's Office of Information Policy. This document is part of a court filing (Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE) and includes a FOIA request from The New York Times reporter Danielle Ivory to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) seeking records related to Jeffrey Epstein's death and prior suicide attempt, the BOP's response denying expedited processing, and an extensive index of documents withheld in full by the BOP under various FOIA exemptions. It reveals the scope of withheld materials concerning Epstein's incarceration and death.",
