    "Psychological assessments consistently noted Epstein denied any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan, both before and after the string incident.",
    "Epstein expressed numerous complaints about jail conditions, including his orange jumpsuit, desire for single-cell housing, lack of property, and fear for his safety if returned with his previous cellmate.",
    "A suicide risk assessment on July 23 concluded Epstein's overall acute suicide risk was 'Moderate' due to the unclear nature of the incident, his high-profile case, and lack of family connections, despite many protective factors.",
    "Epstein sustained marks/scabs around his neck while in the SHU but repeatedly claimed to have no memory of how the injury occurred.",
    "Epstein expressed fear and dissatisfaction with being housed in the SHU, citing noise, smells, perceived danger from MS-13 gang members, and restrictions that hindered work on his legal case.",
    "Clinical staff consistently assessed Epstein's acute suicide risk as low, with him adamantly denying any desire to kill himself because he was invested in fighting his legal case.",
    "Epstein reported that his cellmate had called him a 'pedophile' and was reading a newspaper article about him on the day of the neck injury incident.",
    "The documents show a pattern of Epstein receiving daily legal visits and being primarily concerned with his comfort, legal access, and medication (Colace for constipation)."
