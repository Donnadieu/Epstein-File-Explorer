    "Alfredo Rodriguez, Jeffrey Epstein's former house manager, was the subject of an FBI obstruction of justice case for attempting to sell an address book believed to contain names and numbers of additional, previously unknown underage victims of Epstein.",
    "The FBI was processing telephone records (target number 310-435-4725) from the address book, believed to belong to Epstein, his associates, or potential underage victims.",
    "The document is an internal FBI workflow request (Baleen Sweep) to digitize and analyze these records for the ongoing investigation.",
    "The address book came into Rodriguez's possession during his employment with Epstein, and he attempted to sell it to an Undercover Employee (UCE) instead of complying with federal subpoenas.",
    "The records were considered unclassified, and the scanning process involved handling both evidentiary and non-evidentiary material with specific security protocols."
