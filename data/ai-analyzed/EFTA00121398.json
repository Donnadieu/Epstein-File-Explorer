  "summary": "This is a Bureau of Prisons Psychological Reconstruction Report on the death by suicide of inmate Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Complex (MCC) New York on August 10, 2019. The report details Epstein's background, institutional history, mental health assessments, and the circumstances leading to his death. It identifies numerous procedural failures, inconsistencies in documentation, and staff errors, and provides recommendations for corrective actions. The report is an interim document due to an inability to gather all data, as the FBI had confiscated key evidence.",
