    "Epstein was not on suicide watch at the time of his death (he had only been on suicide watch from July 23-29, 2019) and was not required to have a cellmate.",
    "The FBI seized 18 hard drives of video from the MCC for analysis, though a camera pointed at the SHU hallway was reportedly not functioning as of the Thursday before Epstein's death.",
    "Investigators received a proffer from Epstein's lawyer regarding his last phone call, in which he did not indicate suicidal intent but said 'they are trying to keep me safe' and discussed his case taking longer.",
    "There was a discrepancy between the lawyer's claim of a 20-minute last call and BOP records indicating a 10-second call; investigators were pulling toll records to investigate.",
    "Investigators were considering a charge under 18 U.S.C. § 1519 (destruction/falsification of records) against guards based on admissions they did not perform required rounds and falsified log sheets."
