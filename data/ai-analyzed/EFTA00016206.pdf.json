    "The defense argues the government failed to comply with amended Rule 404(b) notice requirements by not specifically identifying evidence, articulating a non-propensity purpose, and providing reasoning.",
    "The government's disclosure letter referenced emails between Maxwell and 'influential' men about setting up dates and a witness who worked for Epstein from 2005-2006.",
    "The defense claims the government also provided numerous trial exhibits dated after the charged conspiracy (post-2004), such as flight logs from 2005-2013, which were not mentioned in the Rule 404(b) letter.",
    "Maxwell's attorneys request the court either exclude the 404(b) evidence or grant them additional time to investigate and respond to the government's disclosures.",
    "The motion suggests the government's described evidence (emails about adult dating, testimony about post-conspiracy events) does not appear to be 'direct evidence' of the charged conspiracy to traffic minors."
