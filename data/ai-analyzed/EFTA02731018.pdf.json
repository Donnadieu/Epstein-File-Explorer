    "Leon Black paid Jeffrey Epstein $158 million between 2012 and 2017 for tax and estate planning advice, an amount that far exceeded what Black paid his other professional advisors.",
    "Epstein's advice allegedly helped Black avoid an estimated $1 to $2 billion in taxes, including through a 'proprietary' solution for a 2006 trust and a 'step-up-basis transaction' saving an estimated $600 million.",
    "The letter references a Dechert LLP investigation report commissioned by Apollo, which found Black was under the misconception that his payments to Epstein were tax-deductible because Epstein had told him so.",
    "Senator Wyden's inquiry is driven by concerns about the extraordinary compensation to Epstein in light of his role in a human trafficking scheme and the oversight jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee over federal taxation."
