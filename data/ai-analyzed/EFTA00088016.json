  "keyFacts": [
    "The UK Home Office is hesitant to approve an MLA request to interview a material witness because the witness's lawyers (Blackfords) have offered voluntary cooperation, and the Home Office fears a judicial review if they don't exhaust voluntary avenues first.",
    "US officials argue that requiring exhaustion of voluntary cooperation conflicts with the US-UK MLA treaty and would affect many cross-border cases.",
    "There is a \"significant mutual lack of trust\" between the US case team and Blackfords law firm, making a voluntary interview outside the MLA context unlikely.",
    "The material witness is of interest in both the Jeffrey Epstein and Peter Nygard investigations, though the facts on Nygard are described as \"pretty thin.\"",
    "The witness's counsel has stated their client is willing to assist but has not committed to specific steps, leading US officials to question whether this is posturing."
