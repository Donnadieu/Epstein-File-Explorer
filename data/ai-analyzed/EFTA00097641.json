    "The court granted Ghislaine Maxwell's request for a continuance, moving her trial from July 12, 2021, to fall 2021.",
    "The continuance was necessitated by a superseding indictment (S2) filed on March 29, 2021, which added new charges and identified a fourth alleged victim (Minor Victim-4).",
    "The new indictment extended the timeframe of the alleged conspiracies from through 1997 to 2004 and added charges for sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking of a minor.",
    "The court cited the COVID-19 pandemic as a factor hampering trial preparation due to travel constraints and safety concerns.",
    "The order emphasizes balancing the defense's need for preparation time against the public's interest in a trial without undue delay."
