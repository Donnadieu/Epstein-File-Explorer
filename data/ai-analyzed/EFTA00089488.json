    "Tova Noel and Michael Thomas were charged with falsifying BOP count and round forms on the overnight shift of August 9-10, 2019, when Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in his cell.",
    "The memo argues for deferred prosecution, noting Noel claimed she could not complete rounds because co-defendant Thomas refused to assist her and BOP regulations prohibited her from doing them alone.",
    "The document cites precedent cases (United States v. Hernandez, United States v. Marshall) where similar charges against correctional officers resulted in deferred prosecutions, dismissals, or misdemeanor pleas, not felony convictions.",
    "The FBI agent on the case supported deferred prosecution, believing the matter was best handled administratively since the investigation concluded Epstein's death was a suicide without outside assistance or post-facto obstruction.",
    "The memo details significant potential collateral consequences for Noel from a felony conviction, including loss of military disability benefits, disqualification from many government and security jobs, and inability to become an EMT."
