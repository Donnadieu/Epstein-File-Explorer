    "The BOP is withholding four categories of records related to Epstein's incarceration under FOIA Exemption 7(A): inmate count documents, staffing records, psychological records, and specific BOP logs from August 9-10, 2019.",
    "Withholding is justified to prevent interference with the pending 'Noel' prosecution (likely against BOP staff) and the 'Tartaglione' prosecution, as premature disclosure could influence witness testimony and jury selection.",
    "Specific records detail Epstein's apparent suicide attempt on July 23, 2019, and the circumstances of his death on August 9-10, 2019, including SHU occupant details and staff rounds.",
    "The declaration cites extensive media coverage and public speculation about Epstein's death as a heightened risk factor that could prejudice potential jurors if records are released prematurely or without full context."
