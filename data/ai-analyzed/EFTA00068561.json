    "The defense proposes displaying documents only on video screens used by the witness, court, and court deputy—screens that do not face the gallery or jury box.",
    "The government opposes the defense's proposed procedure, expressing concern that jurors might see the witness screen, though the defense notes jurors are permitted to know witness identities.",
    "The letter reveals ongoing procedural disputes between defense and prosecution regarding trial efficiency and witness privacy protections."
