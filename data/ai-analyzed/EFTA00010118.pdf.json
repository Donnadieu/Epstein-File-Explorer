Nathan to quash a subpoena issued by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team to the administrator of the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (EVCP).

    "The U.S. government filed a motion to quash Ghislaine Maxwell's subpoena to the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (EVCP) administrator, arguing it fails legal standards.",
    "The defense sought four categories of EVCP information: payment records, claim release forms, all material submitted by victims, and all communications.",
    "The government argues the subpoena is a 'fishing expedition' and that the requested information is either already in the defense's possession or not relevant/admissible.",
    "The document references 'Minor Victims' including 'Witness-3' and 'Accuser-2', and notes the court ordered that Witness-3 should not be referenced at trial as a victim.",
    "The government contends that exploring EVCP materials at trial would confuse the jury and waste time, as the trial is not about the EVCP's adjudicative process."
