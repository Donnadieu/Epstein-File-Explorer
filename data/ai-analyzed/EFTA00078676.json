    "The Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (EVCP) was designed as a confidential, non-adversarial alternative to litigation for victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein and related parties.",
    "Confidentiality is described as a 'cornerstone' and 'absolute imperative' of the EVCP, critical for victims of sexual abuse, particularly those distrustful of the justice system, to participate.",
    "The EVCP Protocol was approved by the Probate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands and grants the administrator complete autonomy over claim determinations.",
    "Ghislaine Maxwell has subpoenaed the EVCP administrator for program documents, which this declaration argues would violate confidentiality, court orders, and public policy.",
    "The declaration corrects what it states are inaccurate characterizations in Maxwell's motion regarding how the EVCP Protocol evaluates claims."
