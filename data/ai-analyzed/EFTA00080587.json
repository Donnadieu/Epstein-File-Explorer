    "Evidence included images seized during 2019 searches of Epstein residences that were not from electronic device extractions and therefore lacked CART numbers.",
    "The defense requested metadata overlays with original metadata for files where metadata indicated creation/modification dates after the devices were seized.",
    "There was a Bates number gap between November 18 and December 18, 2020 productions that the prosecution needed to address."
