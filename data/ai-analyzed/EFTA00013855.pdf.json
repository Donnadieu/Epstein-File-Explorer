    "The letter seeks clarification on ambiguous provisions in the Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office, particularly Paragraph 8 regarding liability waivers.",
    "It references prior acknowledgments by Mr. Acosta that the NPA language is 'far from simple' and subject to significant ambiguity.",
    "The attorney argues that the liability waiver was intended to allow a plaintiff to assert only a single violation, not multiple violations, and should not preclude statute of limitations defenses.",
    "The correspondence aims to prevent future misunderstandings and adversarial relations, emphasizing Epstein's intent to fully abide by the NPA.",
    "The letter is part of ongoing, complex litigation surrounding Epstein's NPA obligations, indicating continued legal disputes years after the agreement."
