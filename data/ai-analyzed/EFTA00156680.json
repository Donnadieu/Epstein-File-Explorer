  "keyFacts": [
    "The expert, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, emphasizes that sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through manipulation and coercion within an established relationship over time, not just forcible rape.",
    "Dr. Rocchio challenges the language that victims are 'susceptible,' stating it is more accurate to say they are 'targeted,' shifting the onus away from the victim.",
    "The testimony will cover 'complex trauma,' a condition resulting from prolonged childhood abuse by caregivers or trusted adults, which leads to more severe outcomes than PTSD, including distorted perceptions of the perpetrator.",
    "The document notes that nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among abuse victims due to fear, shame, humiliation, and fear of not being believed or retaliation.",
    "Dr. Rocchio's qualifications include training psychiatric residents at Brown University, serving on the APA Ethics Committee, and running a forensic practice evaluating survivors of sexual abuse and trauma."
