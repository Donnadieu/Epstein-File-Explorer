  "summary": "This document contains a series of Bureau of Prisons psychology service records for inmate Jeffrey Epstein from July 29 to August 8, 2019, at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York (MCC-NY/NYM). The records detail clinical contacts, suicide risk assessments, and a disciplinary competency evaluation following an incident on July 23, 2019, where Epstein was found with a string around his neck. The records consistently note Epstein denies suicidal ideation, expresses future orientation, and is deemed psychologically stable and competent. This document contains multiple Bureau of Prisons clinical psychology reports from July 2019 documenting Jeffrey Epstein's mental status and conditions while on psychological observation/suicide watch at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York. The reports detail his complaints about SHU conditions, his claimed memory loss about neck injuries, and his psychological evaluations. This document contains a series of Bureau of Prisons psychology service notes and suicide risk assessments for Jeffrey Epstein from July 10-24, 2019, while he was incarcerated at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) New York. It details his psychological state, an incident on July 23 where he was found with a string around his neck, his subsequent placement on and removal from suicide watch, and his interactions with prison psychologists. This document contains multiple Bureau of Prisons psychological assessment forms for Jeffrey Epstein, conducted on July 9, 2019, the day after a court proceeding. It includes a suicide risk assessment, diagnostic formulation, and care level classification, all concluding he showed no acute mental health issues, no suicidality, and was classified as low risk. The assessments were prompted by precautionary measures due to his high-profile case and recent court appearance. This document contains multiple Bureau of Prisons psychological assessments for Jeffrey Epstein conducted on July 8-10, 2019, at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York (MCC-NY). It includes a suicide risk assessment, intake screening, and risk of sexual abusiveness evaluation, all concluding Epstein was at low risk, mentally stable, and denied suicidal ideation.",
