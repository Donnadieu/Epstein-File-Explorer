  "summary": "This document is a series of emails from whistleblower Christopher J. Dilorio to various judges and SEC officials, appealing the SEC's preliminary denial of his whistleblower award claim related to the Oppenheimer AML action (2015-016). Dilorio alleges massive, ongoing securities fraud involving abusive naked short selling, money laundering through OTC market shells, and criminal obstruction by the SEC and DOJ to protect entities like Knight Capital/KCG/Virtu (NITE) and Jefferies. He claims his information was used by regulators to bring complaints while simultaneously being suppressed to protect powerful financial figures and institutions.",
