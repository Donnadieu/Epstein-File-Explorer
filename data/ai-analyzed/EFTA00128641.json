  "summary": "An FBI communication from Baltimore to Miami forwarding a criminal referral from U.S. District Judge Joseph J. Farnan Jr. regarding an attempted $15 million bridge loan fraud involving Wintel Telecom Holdings Inc. and Jeffrey Epstein. The referral details Epstein's discovery of forged collateral documents purporting to secure the loan with U.S. Treasury Bonds, linking the fraud to subject John Raymond Macari. This document is a collection of faxes and financial records from December 2001 concerning a proposed $15 million bridge loan from Jeffrey Epstein to WinTel Telecom Holdings, Inc. for the acquisition of Winstar Communications, Inc. out of bankruptcy. The documents show the loan was to be secured by $130 million in U.S. Treasuries held by Century Capital, S.A., but the deal collapses when the fiduciary, Williams Management & Capital Group, Ltd., withdraws citing issues with verification and a fraudulent bank officer.",
