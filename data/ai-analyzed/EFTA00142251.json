    "The witness (MR. I.) stated he told the vendor, SigNet, to hold off on shipping new cameras in 2018 due to storage space issues and part number/approval problems, not because of technical incompetence.",
    "The camera system at MCC was not recording and video could not be retrieved on August 8, 2019, just days before Epstein's death. The issue was reportedly fixed later.",
    "The witness pulled a phone record showing a 21-minute call from the SHU on August 9, 2019, at 6:58 p.m., which investigators believe was Epstein's last phone call.",
    "The camera upgrade project was massively behind schedule; as of August 2019, only one housing unit had been fully prepared for new cameras, and the project was still incomplete years later when MCC closed.",
    "The witness did not have a key to the room containing the camera DVR recorders prior to Epstein's death; access was controlled by SIS staff, which he described as a security problem."
