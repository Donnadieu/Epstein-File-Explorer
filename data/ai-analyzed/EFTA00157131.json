  "keyFacts": [
    "The FBI was processing terabytes of digital evidence seized from Jeffrey Epstein's New York and U.S. Virgin Islands properties, including phones, tablets, laptops, desktop computers, servers, DVRs, cameras, and loose media.",
    "Significant challenges existed in transferring the data into a format usable by the U.S. Attorney's Office for discovery and taint review, specifically for loading into the Relativity e-discovery platform.",
    "Specific devices mentioned as not yet transferred included 2 Macs, a DVR, an iPhone, and an iPad from the New York seizure.",
    "The email chain reveals internal coordination issues and delays, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic reducing FBI office presence to one day a week.",
    "A key problem identified was that previously transferred data (over 1.1 million documents) lacked proper linking between emails and attachments, making review and future production to defense counsel difficult."
