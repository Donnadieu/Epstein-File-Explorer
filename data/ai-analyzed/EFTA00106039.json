  "summary": "This is a 2021 opinion and order by Judge Alison J. Nathan denying Ghislaine Maxwell's motion to suppress evidence obtained via a grand jury subpoena to the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (BSF). Maxwell argued the subpoena violated her Fifth and Fourth Amendment rights and due process because the documents were under a protective order from prior civil litigation. The court rejects all arguments, finding no constitutional violation and no basis for suppression or an evidentiary hearing. This is a court opinion and order (Document 307) filed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on June 25, 2021, in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell. The order denies Maxwell's motions to suppress evidence obtained via a grand jury subpoena that modified a protective order from prior civil litigation. The court analyzes claims of prosecutorial misconduct, due process violations, and the applicability of the Franks standard, concluding Maxwell failed to make the required showing for suppression or an evidentiary hearing.",

    "The court denied Ghislaine Maxwell's motion to suppress her deposition transcripts and other documents obtained by the government via a grand jury subpoena to her former civil adversary's law firm, Boies Schiller Flexner LLP.",
    "The court ruled Maxwell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in documents produced in civil litigation, even under a protective order, and thus the government's subpoena did not violate her Fourth Amendment rights.",
    "The court held that a civil protective order does not guarantee testimony will be shielded from a subsequent criminal prosecution, and Maxwell could have invoked her Fifth Amendment right during the civil depositions but did not.",
    "The document reveals that attorneys for Maxwell's civil accuser approached the U.S. Attorney's Office in early 2016, identifying Maxwell as Epstein's 'head recruiter' of underage girls, though no investigation was pursued at that time.",
    "Maxwell is charged in the superseding indictment with making false statements under oath in the two depositions she gave in the 2015 civil case.",
    "The court denies Ghislaine Maxwell's motions to suppress evidence obtained by the government through a grand jury subpoena that modified a protective order from her prior civil litigation.",
    "The court applies the standard from Franks v. Delaware, requiring a showing of deliberate or reckless misrepresentation by the government and materiality to the judge's decision, and finds Maxwell failed to make a 'substantial preliminary showing' on either prong.",
    "The opinion details an April 9, 2019 hearing before Judge McMahon where a prosecutor disclosed communications with law firm Boies Schiller Flexner (BSF) after the investigation began but not about a 2016 meeting; the court finds this omission was not a deliberate/reckless misrepresentation and was not necessary to Judge McMahon's ruling.",
    "Judge McMahon's decision to modify the protective order was based on two independent grounds: that Maxwell could not have reasonably relied on the order to keep evidence from prosecutors, and that the government showed 'extraordinary circumstances' justifying ex parte modification.",
    "The court rejects Maxwell's arguments that the government's actions violated due process or justified suppression under the court's inherent supervisory authority, finding no 'fundamentally unfair' or 'outrageous' misconduct."
