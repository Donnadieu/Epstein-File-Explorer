  "summary": "This is a motion filed by attorneys for the independent administrator of the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (EVCP) to quash a subpoena from Ghislaine Maxwell seeking documents related to four victims. The motion argues that compliance would violate the program's foundational promise of confidentiality, that the sought materials are inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 408, and that they constitute witness statements not subject to subpoena under Rule 17(h).",
