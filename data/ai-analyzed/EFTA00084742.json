    "The Florida NPA is stated to have immunized not just Epstein, but also 'a number of his alleged co-conspirators,' including a New York-based 'booker' responsible for scheduling 'massages' with underage girls.",
    "The investigation is actively identifying New York-based victims and plans to investigate allegations of misconduct that occurred after the 2008 Florida NPA was signed.",
    "The document is an internal government update, indicating the investigation was active and a significant priority for the Public Corruption Unit as of December 2018."
