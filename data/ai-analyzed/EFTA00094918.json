    "UK Home Office officials are concerned about potential judicial review litigation from Blackfords law firm if they don't exhaust voluntary cooperation avenues before proceeding with MLA request.",
    "There is a 'significant mutual lack of trust' between the US case team and Blackfords law firm, making voluntary interview outside MLA context unlikely.",
    "The material witness's team has offered voluntary cooperation multiple times, including in early June 2020, which complicates the MLA process.",
    "US officials argue that requiring exhaustion of informal avenues conflicts with the US-UK MLA treaty and would affect many cases going forward.",
    "The witness is referred to as 'Material Witness PA' and the investigation involves questions about both Epstein and another subject where facts are described as 'pretty thin'."
