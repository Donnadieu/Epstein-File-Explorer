    "The Maxwell case involved 'multiple times more discovery' than the Rivera case, justifying greater need for expanded electronic access.",
    "Judge Engelmayer described the disparity in accommodations between Maxwell and Rivera as 'strikingly different' with 'terrible' optics and requested a formal explanation from the BOP.",
    "By late December 2020, the MCC began leaving a laptop with Rivera all day for charging only at night, effectively matching Maxwell's electronic discovery access at MDC.",
    "Defense counsel for Rivera suggested the differing treatment might be due to race, gender, and class, prompting judicial scrutiny."
