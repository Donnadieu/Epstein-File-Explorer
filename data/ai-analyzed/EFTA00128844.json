  "summary": "This document is a 2020 response from the Virgin Islands Lieutenant Governor's Office to a court subpoena regarding Southern Country International Ltd. (SCI), an International Financial Services Entity. It includes a certificate of authenticity and an attached 2013 application for Financial Strategy Group, Ltd. (FSG), which lists Jeffrey Epstein as its 100% owner and president. This document is part of an application package for the Financial Strategy Group, Ltd. (FSG) to obtain an International Banking Entity license in the U.S. Virgin Islands. It includes the Articles of Incorporation for FSG, a biographical affidavit from Jeffrey Epstein (the sole shareholder and president), and supporting information about the company's proposed activities and officers. The document reveals Epstein's central role in the entity and provides details about his background, his 2008 guilty plea, and his financial operations in the Virgin Islands. A later Certificate of Licensure shows a related entity, Southern Country International, Ltd., was licensed in 2019.",
