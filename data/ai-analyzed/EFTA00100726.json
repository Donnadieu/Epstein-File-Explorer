  "summary": "This document is a series of internal U.S. Department of Justice emails from June 18, 2020, discussing challenges in obtaining an interview with Prince Andrew as a material witness in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation via a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) request to the United Kingdom. The emails reveal the UK Home Office's reluctance to proceed due to perceived lack of predication regarding Prince Andrew's knowledge or involvement, concerns about potential judicial review litigation, and a breakdown in trust between the U.S. prosecution team and Prince Andrew's lawyers (Blackfords).",

    "The UKCA was concerned that approving the MLAT would lead to a judicial review lawsuit from Blackfords, arguing the Home Office failed to exhaust avenues for voluntary cooperation first.",
    "Prince Andrew's legal team had stated as recently as early June 2020 that he was willing to voluntarily assist the investigation, which the UKCA cited as a reason to delay the MLAT.",
    "The U.S. DOJ argued that requiring exhaustion of informal avenues before an MLAT conflicted with the US-UK treaty and would affect many future cases."
