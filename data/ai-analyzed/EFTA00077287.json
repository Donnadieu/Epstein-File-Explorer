    "U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman made highly unusual public statements criticizing Prince Andrew's lack of cooperation in the Epstein co-conspirator investigation, departing from standard DOJ practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations.",
    "Prince Andrew, after a widely criticized BBC interview in November 2019, stated he was willing to help law enforcement but, according to Berman, subsequently refused to submit to an interview.",
    "The article analyzes whether Berman's comments violated DOJ rules (Rule 6(e) grand jury secrecy, 28 C.F.R. §50.2, U.S. Attorney's Manual), concluding they likely did not violate Rule 6(e) but may have conflicted with manual guidelines discouraging comment on an investigation's 'nature or progress.'",
    "Prince Andrew faces significant legal pressure, including potential use of mutual legal assistance treaties (MLAT) or Hague Convention procedures to secure his testimony, and risks perjury charges due to specific alibis given in his BBC interview.",
    "The author, Evan T. Barr, discloses he previously worked on a legal matter for Jeffrey Epstein years ago at another law firm."
