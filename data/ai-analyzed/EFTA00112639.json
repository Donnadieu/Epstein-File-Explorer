  "summary": "This is a transcript of a voluntary sworn interview conducted by the DOJ Office of the Inspector General on March 21, 2022, with former Federal Bureau of Prisons employee Jeffrey (last name redacted). The interview is part of an OIG investigation into the events surrounding the death of inmate Jeffrey Epstein at MCC New York. The witness provides background on his employment history and role at MCC. This document appears to be a transcript of an interview with a former Bureau of Prisons employee (likely a general foreman/facilities manager) regarding camera system upgrades and maintenance at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) around 2018-2019. The interview focuses on the employee's role, the status of camera projects, and issues with camera functionality prior to Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration. This document is a transcript of a deposition or interview regarding a contract for a camera system upgrade at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) New York. The discussion focuses on a contract with SigNet Technologies, awarded in September 2018, for the purchase and installation of over 200 cameras and related equipment. The witness, a former facilities manager, states that no cameras or major equipment were delivered or installed before his departure in February 2019, contradicting claims from SigNet and other staff. This document is a transcript of an interview conducted by Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General agents with a former Bureau of Prisons employee (referred to as MR. [REDACTED]). The interview focuses on the installation and oversight of a camera system at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) New York, specifically addressing the location of equipment, chain of custody, and unusual access protocols for communications technicians. The interviewee reveals that key equipment was not on-site as previously believed and describes irregular security practices.",

    "The witness's direct supervisor, the Facility Manager, left MCC under unusual circumstances after a conference in Denver and never returned, with communication stopping entirely.",
    "After the Facility Manager's departure, oversight of the department shifted between an Executive Assistant and various Associate Wardens of Operations, and the witness informally absorbed some duties.",
    "The OIG investigators reference a specific contract (SigNet) with an award date of September 21, 2018, that lists the witness as a point of contact.",
    "There were longstanding camera issues at MCC, including broken cameras and outdated analog recorders, which hampered investigations even before Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration.",
    "A camera upgrade project was initiated to switch from analog to digital recorders and add new cameras, but the project faced budget constraints and was reduced from over $1 million to around $800,000.",
    "The interviewee's role as 'acting facility manager' was informal and sporadic, with oversight from executive staff, and he maintained the title in his email signature despite not being officially promoted.",
    "Cameras in the Special Housing Unit (SHU) were frequently damaged or obscured by inmates, and functionality was inconsistent.",

    "The contract's stated delivery date of 09/28/2018 was deemed unrealistic by the witness, who estimated installation alone would take over a year.",
    "Internal BOP emails from April 2019 indicate the project was delayed because necessary fiber cable had not been delivered.",
    "There is confusion and lack of tracking information regarding whether and when the camera equipment was actually delivered to the MCC loading dock.",
    "The interviewee stated that camera system equipment for MCC New York was stored off-site at 'Building 4' in the Brooklyn Navy Shipyard, not on-site as investigators previously believed.",
    "Communications technicians at MCC New York had unusual access to live camera feeds and related equipment in their office, a practice the witness found irregular compared to other BOP institutions.",
    "The witness described MCC New York's administration as having 'too many hands in the pot' with multiple wardens, assistant wardens, and facility managers involved in decisions.",
    "The interview reveals significant confusion and lack of oversight regarding the procurement and installation of the camera system, with the witness surprising investigators with new information."
