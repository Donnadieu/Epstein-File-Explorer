  "summary": "This is a daily lieutenant's log from the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York, NY, dated August 8, 2019. It details routine prison operations, inmate counts, movements, and administrative actions across three shifts (Morning, Day, and Evening Watch). The log records inmate transfers, medical trips, court appearances, and the placement of one inmate on suicide watch. It is significant as it documents the operational environment of the facility where Jeffrey Epstein was held, on the day before his death.",
