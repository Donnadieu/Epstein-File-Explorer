  "keyFacts": [
    "The BOP Lieutenant testified that on August 8, 2019, the entire camera system at MCC New York was not recording, and many camera feeds were completely blacked out, contradicting prior understanding that cameras were up but just not recording.",
    "A communications technician reportedly told the Lieutenant he \"fixed the camera system\" on August 9th, but the Lieutenant assumed this meant he got the live feeds working, not that recording functionality was restored.",
    "Jeffrey Epstein was allowed to make a personal phone call on August 9, 2019, from the SHU on a line meant for legal calls, which was against policy as it was unmonitored and unrecorded.",
    "The Lieutenant stated it was her understanding that a Unit Manager gave Epstein the phone call to his mother (who was reportedly deceased), but this was hearsay.",
    "Standard BOP policy requires all inmate calls to be monitored/recorded for security, and exceptions for personal calls in crisis must be made on a recorded line with notification to SIS, which did not happen in this case."
