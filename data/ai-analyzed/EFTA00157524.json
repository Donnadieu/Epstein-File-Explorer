    "Evidence file GX 332 is a picture copied from a compact disk (CD) to a computer, with its metadata (GX 332B) showing the 'created date' reflects when it was copied, not necessarily when the photo was taken.",
    "A computer referenced as GX 54 had three user accounts, with one named 'ghislaine' showing over 400 logins, while the default 'guest' and 'administrator' accounts showed zero logins.",
    "The document indicates that once a file is burned onto a CD, it cannot be 'unburned,' and on the original CD, the created date and modified date would be the same.",
    "The date May 7, 2002, associated with the photo file, represents when it was put on the CD or copied/burned onto a computer, not necessarily the date the photograph was taken."
