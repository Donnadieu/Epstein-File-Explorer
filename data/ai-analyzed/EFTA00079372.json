  "summary": "This document is a chain of emails from September 2020 between the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the UK law firm Blackfords LLP, representing Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. The correspondence details the U.S. prosecutors' attempts to secure a voluntary interview with Prince Andrew regarding the investigation into Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, and the Duke's refusal, offering only a limited written statement. The U.S. side ultimately states its intent to proceed with a compelled interview request via the UK Central Authority.",
