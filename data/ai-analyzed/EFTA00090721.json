  "summary": "This is a reply brief filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team in support of her motions in limine ahead of her criminal trial. The document argues for the exclusion of various types of evidence, including co-conspirator statements, Rule 404(b) evidence, expert testimony on 'grooming,' and specific exhibits. It also addresses issues like witness identification, the use of the term 'victim,' and evidence related to alleged rape. The filing reveals procedural disputes and the defense's strategy to limit the scope of the government's case.",
