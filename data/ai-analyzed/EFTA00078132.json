Dilorio alleges a massive, ongoing fraud involving the SEC, Jefferies, and Virtu Financial (NITE), including criminal obstruction, accounting fraud, and money laundering through OTC markets. He claims his whistleblower information has been ignored or used selectively to protect entities like NITE while prosecuting others, and he seeks to expose this corruption to aid in the case of Dan Kamensky.",
