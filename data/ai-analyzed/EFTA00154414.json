    "The legal opinion concludes it is 'extremely unlikely' Ghislaine Maxwell would be granted bail in the UK if she fled there in breach of US bail, and 'highly unlikely' she could successfully resist extradition.",
    "Ghislaine Maxwell signed a waiver of her right to contest extradition to the US, which would be admissible in UK proceedings and could expedite removal to 1-3 months.",
    "The opinion analyzes potential bars to extradition (forum, passage of time, human rights) and finds they would almost certainly fail in Maxwell's case given the seriousness of the charges and her alleged conduct.",
    "The document references a superseding indictment against Maxwell dated July 2020, with alleged offenses occurring between 1994 and 1997.",
    "The opinion was commissioned by Maxwell's UK legal team, Peters and Peters, in August 2020, during her US bail proceedings."
