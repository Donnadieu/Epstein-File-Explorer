    "The document records a 2021 expert discussion on memory, specifically addressing the reliability of memories of sexual abuse from adolescence.",
    "Gail Goodman argues that memories for self-relevant, traumatic events (like sexual abuse) are often strong and accurate, contrary to some false memory research.",
    "Goodman cites her own studies, including one following 200 child sexual abuse victims in Denver courts in the 1980s, to support the reliability of such memories.",
    "The discussion critiques Elizabeth Loftus's false memory research as being based on contrived, low-stakes studies that may not generalize to real traumatic events.",
    "The document suggests memory is particularly robust for events occurring in adolescence (the 'adolescent bump'), which is relevant to many allegations in the Epstein case."
