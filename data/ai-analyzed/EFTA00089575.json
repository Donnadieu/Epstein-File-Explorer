    "The FBI was hesitant to provide generic letters stating the individuals were victims of a federal crime by Epstein, as not all interviewed 'girls' necessarily met that legal threshold.",

    "The correspondence is from the NYPD/FBI Child Exploitation Human Trafficking Task Force, indicating an active, multi-agency investigation.",
