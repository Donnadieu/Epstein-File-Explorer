    "The defense identified significant discovery deficiencies including corrupt Excel spreadsheets, mismatched metadata, and inability to properly match photo files with their corresponding metadata.",
    "Photographic evidence was recovered from CDs at Epstein's residence and produced as SDNY011, containing 40,567 files with non-nude images.",
    "The government designated some photos as 'highly confidential' containing 'nude, partially-nude, or otherwise sexualized images' but defense counsel stated they did not observe child pornography among what they could view.",
    "There were discrepancies between file counts in the production (40,567) and the non-nude index (40,536), with hash value mismatches preventing proper file matching.",
    "The defense requested production of all 'highly confidential' images to properly prepare their case, noting the extraordinary cost and burden of reviewing them only in government offices."
