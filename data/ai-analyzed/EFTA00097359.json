  "summary": "This is a reply memorandum filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team in support of her motion to sever Counts 5 and 6 (perjury charges) from Counts 1-4 (Mann Act charges) in her criminal case. The document argues that the perjury counts from a 2016 civil deposition are improperly joined with the older sex trafficking charges and that a joint trial would introduce highly prejudicial and inadmissible evidence.",

    "The defense argues the perjury charges (from a 2016 civil deposition) are improperly joined with sex trafficking charges from 1994-1997, occurring 22 years later.",
    "The perjury stems from a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre, which concerned her allegations of being trafficked to famous people like Alan Dershowitz—allegations the defense calls 'obvious lies'.",
    "The defense claims a joint trial would force the introduction of extensive, prejudicial evidence about the civil defamation case, CVRA litigation, and allegations unrelated to the three accusers in the indictment.",
    "The filing reveals a potential conflict: Maxwell's current criminal defense lawyers also represented her in the 2016 civil deposition, meaning they could become witnesses if the perjury counts are tried, potentially requiring their disqualification.",
    "The defense accuses the government of adding the perjury counts to call Maxwell a liar in front of the jury and to introduce prejudicial evidence of alleged sexual abuse 'through the back door'."
