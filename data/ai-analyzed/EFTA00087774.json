  "summary": "This is a motion in limine filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team seeking to exclude evidence related to 'Accuser-3' from her criminal trial. The motion argues that Accuser-3 was not a minor under UK law during the alleged encounters, that no illegal travel was induced, and therefore her testimony is irrelevant, inadmissible under Rule 404(b), and unfairly prejudicial. The defense requests exclusion or, alternatively, strict limitations on how the testimony is presented to the jury.",

    "The defense argues 'Accuser-3' was above the age of consent (16) in the United Kingdom during the alleged encounters with Jeffrey Epstein in 1994-1995, meaning the alleged sex acts were not illegal under UK law.",
    "The defense states the government concedes Accuser-3 cannot establish she was a minor when she allegedly traveled to the United States (Florida, USVI, New York) at Epstein and Maxwell's invitation, or when she engaged in sex acts there.",
    "The motion claims the government included Accuser-3's allegations in the indictment based on a mistaken belief she was a minor, as indicated by grand jury testimony from an FBI Special Agent and an NYPD Detective.",
    "The defense seeks to preclude the government and Accuser-3 from using the terms 'minor' and 'sexually abused' in relation to Accuser-3, arguing these terms are legally inaccurate and misleading to a jury.",
    "The document reveals the charged conspiracies are Mann Act violations (Counts One and Three), specifically conspiring to entice minors to travel for unlawful sexual activity and to transport a minor with intent for unlawful sexual activity."
