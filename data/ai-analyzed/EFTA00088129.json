    "The email chain details the active transfer and processing of digital evidence from numerous devices (referenced by NYC evidence numbers like NYCO24332, NYC027913) in the Epstein investigation as of August 2020.",
    "Evidence processing involved challenges such as duplicate folders, missing items, and approximately 71,000 zero-byte (empty) files recovered from initial device extractions, which was noted as not unusual for forensic software.",
    "Some evidence items, specifically two servers with multiple drives, were noted as physically failed and required specialized hardware recovery at an HQ facility, indicating a complex and lengthy data recovery process.",
    "The correspondence is focused on administrative coordination for uploading evidence to 'Relativity,' a document review platform commonly used in legal proceedings, highlighting the procedural phase of evidence handling post-seizure."
