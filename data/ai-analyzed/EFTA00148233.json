  "keyFacts": [
    "Over 1 million documents were received from seized devices, but reviewers had no way to link emails to their attachments (e.g., a reference to 'attached flight records' could not be connected to the actual records).",
    "Technical failures included load files that did not match native files, making many large files 'completely invisible' to the review team and creating a major production problem for defense counsel.",
    "Seized items included approximately 40+ digital storage devices from a New York mansion and more than 25 devices from the Virgin Islands, including servers, with many items (like Macs) still pending processing.",
    "The correspondence reveals significant post-seizure evidence management challenges, including a lack of a basic inventory to track which devices had been processed and what data had been transferred, described as potentially 'a total disaster' for the review."
