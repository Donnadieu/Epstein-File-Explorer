    "The government anticipated that several witnesses in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial would testify using pseudonyms or first names, a measure granted by the court to protect victim-witnesses describing sensitive and explicit illegal sexual abuse.",
    "The press guidance was being prepared to manage high media demand and ensure efficient communication, highlighting the high-profile nature of the trial.",
    "Government exhibits for the trial were to be provided exclusively through a secure SDNY file share (USAFx), requiring media to establish accounts for access.",
    "The document reveals internal SDNY coordination and caution regarding commitments to daily press guidance on witnesses, due to the difficulty of reliably knowing the next day's testifying witnesses in advance.",
    "The case is formally titled U.S. v. Ghislaine Maxwell, charging her with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to engage in criminal sexual activity."
