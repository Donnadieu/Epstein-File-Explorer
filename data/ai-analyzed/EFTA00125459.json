    "Mark Epstein claims forensic evidence shows Jeffrey Epstein was dead for 2-6 hours when found.",
    "The neck groove is described as too narrow to match a sheet noose, more like an electric cord, suggesting garroting rather than hanging.",
    "The groove's position low on the neck, not higher towards the ears, is cited as inconsistent with hanging.",
    "The email directly challenges the official cause and manner of Jeffrey Epstein's death in custody."
