    "Discrepancies in inmate counts for the SHU on August 9-10 are noted, with counts possibly being falsified or improvised.",
    "The lieutenant stated that if counts and rounds were not conducted, it would be a serious failure, as counting inmates is a primary duty.",
    "The interview reveals a breakdown in the chain of command regarding the communication of Epstein's cellmate requirement, with the operations lieutenant identified as key in disseminating such information."
