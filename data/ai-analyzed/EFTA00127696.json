    "The interview confirms that the camera system in the MCC was not working properly on August 9-10, 2019, when Jeffrey Epstein died.",
    "The witness, R. , states he was never informed about the camera malfunction by the responsible com tech, Mr. , and believes it would have been unacceptable for staff to leave the facility knowing the cameras were down.",
    "The witness's understanding of Epstein's death is that officers failed to do rounds, and Epstein hung himself. He suggests prevention could have involved suicide watch or a cellmate.",
    "The witness identifies only a few staff (the com tech, electrician Maurice Ling, and the Facilities Manager) as having potential access to service or potentially disable the camera system.",
    "The document is part of an official OIG investigation into \"job performance failure and security failure\" related to Epstein's death."
