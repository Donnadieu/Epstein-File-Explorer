  "keyFacts": [
    "The interview reveals significant discrepancies in inmate counts in the Special Housing Unit on the night before and morning of Epstein's death. Count slips showed 73 inmates when there should have been 72, due to an inmate being in R&D dry cell but not properly keyed out of the SHU system.",
    "The witness, a Senior Officer Specialist, was working as Control #1 on August 9 (4pm-midnight) and Internal #2 on August 10 (midnight-8am). He acknowledges potentially 'dropping the ball' by not correcting count paperwork but cannot recall specific conversations or when annotations were made on count slips.",
    "The witness states he believes Epstein committed suicide alone, but suggests systemic problems like lack of staff, failure to keep him on suicide watch, and failure to ensure he had a cellmate contributed to the death.",
    "The document indicates that correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas submitted count slips for the SHU that were inaccurate (showing 73 inmates instead of the correct 72) for multiple counts (4pm, 10pm on Aug 9, and 12am on Aug 10).",
    "The witness mentions hearing rumors that a judge may have contacted the warden regarding Epstein's access to lawyers and paperwork, potentially leading to his premature removal from suicide watch, but clarifies this is just rumor."
