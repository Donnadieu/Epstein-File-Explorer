    "The letter claims Ghislaine Maxwell's pre-trial detention conditions are 'inhumane and degrading,' citing lack of proper food, reading glasses, and returned correspondence.",
    "The writer states Maxwell has been in solitary confinement since July 2020 and could remain so until July 2021, which they argue jeopardizes her ability to prepare a defense.",
    "The central argument for bail is that Maxwell poses no danger to the public and is not a flight risk, as she had opportunity to leave the U.S. before her arrest and did not.",
    "The letter is written in the context of COVID-19 lockdowns, drawing a parallel between general liberty restrictions and Maxwell's loss of liberty."
