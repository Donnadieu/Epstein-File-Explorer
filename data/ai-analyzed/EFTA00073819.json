  "summary": "This is a letter from Jeffrey Epstein's defense attorneys to Judge Richard M. Berman, supplementing Epstein's request for bail. It argues against the government's position that Epstein's wealth creates an irrebuttable presumption for detention, proposes conditions for release including a forensic accounting, and addresses various government concerns such as his New Mexico registration status and an expired Austrian passport.",
