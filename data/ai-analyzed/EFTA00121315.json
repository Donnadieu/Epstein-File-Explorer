  "summary": "A series of Bureau of Prisons (BOP) medical records for inmate Jeffrey Epstein, covering his intake and health assessments in July 2019. The most significant entry documents an injury assessment on July 23, 2019, where Epstein was found in his cell with a rope around his neck and placed on suicide watch, though he claimed not to know how the injury occurred. This document is a compilation of Bureau of Prisons (BOP) health services records for inmate Jeffrey Epstein, covering his initial intake and subsequent medical encounters in July 2019 at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York (NYM). It includes a detailed history and physical, vital signs, diagnoses, medications, and administrative notes from the period just prior to his death. This document contains a series of Bureau of Prisons psychology service records for Jeffrey Epstein from July 9-24, 2019, while he was held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) New York. It includes suicide risk assessments, clinical contacts, and administrative notes, culminating in the assessment following an incident on July 23 where Epstein was found with a string around his neck, leading to his placement on suicide watch. The records detail his psychological state, denials of suicidality, and interactions with staff. This document contains Bureau of Prisons psychological assessment forms for Jeffrey Epstein, including a Diagnostic and Care Level Formulation and multiple Suicide Risk Assessments conducted on July 9, 2019, following his return from court the previous day. The assessments were conducted as a precaution due to risk factors but concluded Epstein was at low acute suicide risk with no mental health diagnosis. This document contains Bureau of Prisons psychological assessment, suicide risk evaluation, and medical records for inmate Jeffrey Epstein from July 8-14, 2019, shortly after his arrest. It includes mental health evaluations, risk assessments for suicide and sexual abusiveness, and medical test results, all indicating Epstein was assessed as low risk for suicide and sexual abusiveness while in custody.",
