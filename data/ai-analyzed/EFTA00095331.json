  "summary": "This is a letter from Plaintiff's counsel (David Boies) to Judge Debra C. Freeman opposing Ghislaine Maxwell's request for a pre-motion conference to stay discovery in a civil lawsuit. The letter argues Maxwell's reasons for a stay (pending criminal investigation, potential claims resolution program, and her motion to dismiss) are meritless and constitute delay tactics.",
