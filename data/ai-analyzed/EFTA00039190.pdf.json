    "This is a standard BOP policy document on Special Housing Units (SHU), not a case-specific record related to Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration or death.",
    "The policy explicitly states that pregnant, post-partum, or post-miscarriage inmates should not be placed in restrictive housing except in rare, temporary situations involving serious immediate risk.",
    "It details strict review procedures for inmates in SHU, including reviews at 3 days, 7 days, and every 30 days, with specific protections for inmates placed in SHU for their own safety (protection cases).",
    "The policy includes guidelines against using alternate clothing/linen (e.g., paper clothing) as punishment and restricts its use for inmates with serious mental illness or suicide risk.",
    "It notes that every effort should be made to avoid releasing an inmate directly from SHU to the community, and if an inmate remains in SHU within 180 days of release, options for less restrictive settings should be considered."
