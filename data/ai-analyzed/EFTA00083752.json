    "The court denied Ghislaine Maxwell's renewed bail motion, reaffirming she is a substantial flight risk.",
    "The denial was based on the serious charges carrying a presumption of detention, strong government evidence including multiple corroborating witnesses, Maxwell's substantial financial resources and foreign ties (including French citizenship), and her lack of candor about her finances.",
    "Maxwell proposed a $28.5 million bail package with home confinement and private security, but the court found it insufficient, noting wealth cannot buy release if a similarly situated defendant would be detained.",
    "The court acknowledged alarming COVID-19 rates at the MDC but stated the pandemic is not a basis for release when a defendant poses a substantial flight risk.",
    "The charges against Maxwell relate to facilitating Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of multiple minor victims between approximately 1994 and 1997."
