    "The document is a broad legal release where a victim accepts compensation from the EVCP and waives all claims against Jeffrey Epstein's estate, its trustees, and a vast network of associated individuals and entities (collectively 'Releasees').",
    "The release explicitly covers claims arising from sexual abuse by Epstein and applies to claims under 'claims revival statutes' enacted in several U.S. jurisdictions, which revive time-barred sexual abuse claims.",
    "The claimant waives rights under California Civil Code Section 1542 and similar laws, meaning she releases even unknown or unsuspected claims that might have affected her decision to settle.",
    "The EVCP Administrator uses Garretson Resolution Group, Inc. (Epiq) to resolve any Medicare/Medicaid liens related to the compensation, with the Epstein Estate paying any negotiated lien amount in addition to the victim's compensation offer.",
    "The release does not require the claimant to maintain confidentiality about her claim or the compensation process, though the Administrator maintains confidentiality of claimant information."
