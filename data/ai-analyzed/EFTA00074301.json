    "A victim/witness, represented by attorney Jeffrey Pop, agreed to meet with SDNY prosecutors and an FBI agent on February 28, 2020, to discuss her knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "The planned discussion topics included the 'logistical' narrative of how the client came into contact with Epstein, her general interactions with him and his associates, Epstein's comments about Maxwell as a 'girl finder', and the client's role in having contact with other girls at Epstein's direction.",
    "The attorney explicitly set boundaries, stating that details of the abuse itself and any information about 'monetary contribution / support/ assistance' involving his client were off-limits to avoid causing emotional trauma.",
    "The client was reportedly hesitant to identify friends of Epstein's that she was directed to visit, indicating knowledge of other individuals in Epstein's network.",
    "The email chain demonstrates the ongoing investigative efforts by the SDNY in early 2020, focusing on victim testimony and the operational dynamics of Epstein's circle."
