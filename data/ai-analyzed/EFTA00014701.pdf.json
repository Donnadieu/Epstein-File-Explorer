    "The court granted the government's motion to preclude defense expert Bennett Gershman from testifying at Ghislaine Maxwell's trial.",
    "The court ruled Gershman's proposed testimony on prosecutorial misconduct and investigative techniques was irrelevant to Maxwell's guilt and would confuse the jury.",
    "The court found the defense's disclosure for Gershman failed to satisfy Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 by listing only general topics instead of his actual opinions.",
    "The court reiterated that while the defense could cross-examine government witnesses on bias, it could not present affirmative evidence attacking the thoroughness of the investigation.",
    "This ruling was a preliminary pre-trial decision, subject to change based on facts and circumstances at trial."
