    "Defense attorneys report major discovery deficiencies, including thousands of unreadable photo files, corrupt Excel spreadsheets, and an inability to match metadata to specific Bates-stamped files.",
    "A significant discrepancy exists regarding the number of 'Highly Confidential' nude/sexualized images: prosecutors initially cited ~2,100 from Epstein's devices, but an FBI report indicates ~33,747 HC images and 895 HC videos.",
    "The government defines 'Highly Confidential' material as containing \"nude, partially-nude, or otherwise sexualized images, videos, or other depictions of individuals\" and restricts defense access, requiring review under law enforcement supervision.",
    "Defense counsel argues that among the HC material they reviewed, there were nude photos of adults but nothing they identified as child pornography, and they request copies of all HC material minus any CP for proper trial preparation.",
    "The correspondence shows ongoing tension over the defense's constitutional right to review all discovery versus the government's security concerns over sensitive imagery."
