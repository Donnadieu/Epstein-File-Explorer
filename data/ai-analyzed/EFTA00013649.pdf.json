  "summary": "This is a Palm Beach Post editorial from November 16, 2007, criticizing the potential plea deal for Jeffrey Epstein. It argues that a plea to a single felony count of solicitation of prostitution, which would not recognize the underage status of the victims, would be an injustice. The editorial details the police investigation, the grand jury indictment, and Epstein's high-powered legal team, expressing concern that wealth can influence the criminal justice system.",
