    "The defense argues that materials related to alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein who do not accuse Ghislaine Maxwell of participation are exculpatory Brady evidence that must be disclosed.",
    "The defense claims the government interviewed 'dozens' of alleged victims of Epstein's sexual abuse, many of whom do not implicate Maxwell.",
    "The perjury charges against Maxwell stem from her 2015 depositions in a defamation lawsuit filed by an alleged victim ('Accuser-1').",
    "The defense contends that evidence of Epstein's sexual activities after 1997 is relevant to the perjury charges because Maxwell was asked about her general knowledge of Epstein's sexual activities.",
    "The government's stated reason for delaying disclosure—that it might deter other alleged victims from coming forward—is argued by the defense to be insufficient to establish 'good cause' under Rule 16(d)(1)."
