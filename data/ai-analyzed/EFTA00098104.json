    "The SDNY Public Corruption Unit, with the FBI, is actively investigating Jeffrey Epstein for allegations of sexually abusing dozens of minors over more than a decade, including those transported to/from New York.",
    "The investigation is examining the 2008 Florida Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA), which the document notes was 'by its terms binding only that office' but 'purported to immunize not only Epstein, but a number of his alleged co-conspirators,' including a New York-based 'booker.'",
    "Investigators are identifying New York-based victims, reviewing documents from the original Florida investigation, and planning to look into post-NPA misconduct allegations.",
    "The SDNY has informed the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida of its investigation; that office 'appreciated the heads up and indicated that they must be recused from it.'",
    "The document references a meeting with high-profile victims' attorneys David Boies and Pete Skinner, indicating early engagement with victim representatives."
