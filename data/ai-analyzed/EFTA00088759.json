The article critically reviews existing definitions of 'grooming' in child sexual abuse, highlights conceptual heterogeneity, and proposes a new two-part definition focusing on inappropriate behavior that functions to increase the likelihood of future sexual abuse. It also discusses the lack of valid assessment methods and the need for further research.",

    "The article critically reviews multiple definitions of 'grooming' in child sexual abuse, noting a lack of consensus and problematic heterogeneity.",
    "The authors propose a new two-part definition: 'antecedent inappropriate behavior that functions to increase the likelihood of future sexual abuse.'",
    "The article highlights the absence of psychometrically valid assessment methods for grooming, which limits its forensic and clinical utility.",
    "Legal attempts to criminalize grooming in various countries (US, UK, New Zealand) are discussed, but definitional problems limit their effectiveness.",
    "The commentary by Park Dietz traces the introduction of the term 'grooming' to the professional literature in 1984 and notes its increasing usage, while cautioning against replacing it with 'seduction' due to historical ambiguities."
