    "U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman expressed that he did not want to be seen as influencing the event's invite list or discouraging Epstein victims from participating.",
    "The correspondence reveals an awareness within the U.S. Attorney's Office of an 'ongoing Epstein-related investigation' and a desire to avoid publicity that could negatively impact bringing additional charges.",
    "The event was framed as an opportunity to publicize federal efforts to prosecute child predators and encourage victims to come forward about 'Epstein and co-conspirators'."
