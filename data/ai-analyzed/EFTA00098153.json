    "The U.S. Attorney's Office requested OCME to redact sensitive materials (including names of prison guards under investigation, witness statements, and MCC documents) before releasing the report to Epstein's brother, Mark Epstein, to protect the ongoing criminal investigation.",
    "A handwritten note found in Epstein's cell was referenced in the report; it was described as a list of grievances about MCC conditions (food, showers, bugs) and was assessed by OCME and investigators as not being a suicide note.",
    "The U.S. Attorney's Office indicated the redaction request might not be permanent and could be revisited after a charging decision is made in the investigation."
