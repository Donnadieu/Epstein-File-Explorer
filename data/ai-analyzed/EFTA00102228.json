    "The government produced 986 pages of records (375 pages of non-email documents and 611 pages of emails) to the court in response to a FOIA request by The New York Times for records related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "Many emails between Tartaglione's defense counsel Bruce Barket and the BOP were collected because the law firm's name 'Barket, Epstein, Kearon, Aldea & LoTurco, LLP' includes 'Epstein' in its signature block, causing it to be captured by electronic search terms.",
    "The government used a detailed color-coded highlighting system to indicate redactions based on specific FOIA exemptions (e.g., red for Exemption 7(A) based on United States v. Noel, goldenrod yellow for Exemption 7(A) based on United States v. Tartaglione).",
    "The government suggests that emails regarding Tartaglione's confinement conditions, while withheld, may not be directly responsive to the Times's FOIA request about Jeffrey Epstein."
