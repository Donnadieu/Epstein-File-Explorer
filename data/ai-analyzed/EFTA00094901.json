    "The document is a formal request to interview three inmates (Leonardo Fernandez, Cristopher Santos Felix, and Edward Jimenez) as witnesses in the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's death.",
    "The investigation focuses on MCC staff's failure to assign a cellmate to Epstein, failure to perform required overnight checks, and falsification of records on the night of August 9-10, 2019.",
    "All three proposed inmate witnesses are currently being prosecuted by the same U.S. Attorney's Office for other crimes, but the memo argues contact is permissible as they are not represented concerning their witness status to Epstein's death.",
    "Investigating agents are instructed to give Miranda warnings, clarify they are not involved in the inmates' own criminal cases, and narrowly focus questions on guard behavior and the specific night of Epstein's death.",
    "The memo notes that ten other inmates were housed in the same SHU area but were deemed inappropriate to approach due to their pending charges."
