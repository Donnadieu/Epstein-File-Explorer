    "Law enforcement was actively seeking to interview prior employees of Jeffrey Epstein in July 2019, specifically those who worked at his New York home during the abuse period.",
    "One target was an 80-year-old former employee who had been living in Nassau County since 2000 and may have worked at Epstein's NY address before Epstein lived there, when it was owned by Wexner.",
    "Investigators were prepared to use subpoenas if the employee refused to be interviewed, and questions focused on knowledge of Epstein, the massage room, and girls coming and going.",
    "A second New York employee was also being sought, but law enforcement lacked a date of birth or good address for them at the time."
