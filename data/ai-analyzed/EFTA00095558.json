    "The OPR investigation concluded that the federal prosecutors, including Alexander Acosta, did not commit professional misconduct in negotiating the 2007 Non-Prosecution Agreement with Jeffrey Epstein, but that Acosta exercised 'poor judgment.'",
    "The NPA immunized Epstein, four named co-conspirators, and 'any potential co-conspirators' from federal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida in exchange for a state guilty plea.",
    "Victims were not informed of or consulted about the NPA before it was signed on September 24, 2007, a fact later ruled a violation of the Crime Victims' Rights Act by a federal court.",
    "After the NPA was signed, the USAO and FBI sent letters to victims stating the case was 'under investigation,' which the court found misled victims, though OPR attributed this to an FBI administrative employee using standard form language.",
    "The report details Epstein's efforts after signing the NPA to invalidate it by appealing to senior DOJ officials, arguing the matter was a 'quintessentially state matter,' an appeal which was ultimately rejected in June 2008."
