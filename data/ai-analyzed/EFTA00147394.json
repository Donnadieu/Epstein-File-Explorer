  "summary": "This is an internal FBI email chain from August 2019 discussing a follow-up inquiry from an attorney regarding a former employee of Jeffrey Epstein and her sister. The FBI agents note they could not find a formal complaint or FBI 302 interview form for the employee, only an Electronic Communication (EC) requesting travel authority to interview her and her sister in North Carolina in 2006. The sister's 2006 interview, conducted as part of the 'MM' case, contained allegations of inappropriate contact with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at a New Mexico ranch in the 1990s. The FBI concluded any victimization was likely outside the statute of limitations and directed the attorney to the official FOIA process.",
