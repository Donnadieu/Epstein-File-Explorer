    "The document is a standardized Bureau of Prisons checklist titled 'National Suicide Prevention Program Suicide Reconstruction Materials' dated June 2013.",
    "It details the extensive evidence and documentation required for a formal reconstruction of an inmate suicide, including securing the scene, collecting electronic data (TRU-INTEL/TRU VIEW reports), video, staff memoranda, and full inmate records.",
    "The procedure mandates coordination by a single point of contact, typically the Special Investigative Agent (SIA), and the creation of a permanent record binder for the reconstruction team.",
    "Required materials span operational logs (sentry documentation, staff sign-in), inmate files (medical, psychological, disciplinary), official reports (police, FBI referral, autopsy), and physical evidence (notes, property).",
    "The document is a generic procedural guide and does not contain information specific to any individual case, including that of Jeffrey Epstein."
