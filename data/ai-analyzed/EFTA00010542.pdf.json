  "summary": "This is the U.S. Government's Response to Petitioners' Submission on Proposed Remedies in the case of Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 v. United States. The government argues that the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) does not authorize the equitable remedies sought by the victims (rescission, apology, informational, educational, and miscellaneous remedies) for the failure to confer with them before entering into a Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) with Jeffrey Epstein. However, the government acknowledges its communication failures and proposes alternative remedies, including a meeting with a DOJ representative, a public victim impact hearing, and additional CVRA training for prosecutors. This is a government response (Document 462) in the ongoing CVRA case regarding the 2007 Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) with Jeffrey Epstein. The government argues against the petitioners' request for partial rescission of the NPA, stating it would harm some victims, lacks legal basis in contract law, and would reward the government for its CVRA violation. It also opposes requests for declaratory and injunctive relief. This is a legal brief filed by the United States Attorney's Office opposing victims' requests for grand jury materials, monetary damages, and other remedies in the Jeffrey Epstein case. It argues the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) does not grant victims access to government files or allow courts to interfere with prosecutorial discretion, and defends the government's proposed remedies.",

    "The government admits it failed to communicate transparently with Epstein's victims about the Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) and regrets that this failure led some to conclude the decision not to prosecute was improper.",
    "The government's legal position is that the CVRA does not authorize the equitable remedies (rescission, apology, etc.) sought by the victims, as the statute provides a specific administrative enforcement scheme instead.",
    "More than a dozen of Epstein's victims invoked the NPA to enter into civil settlements with him while protecting their anonymity.",
    "The government proposes three specific remedies: a meeting with a DOJ representative for victims, a public court hearing for victim impact statements, and mandatory CVRA training for prosecutors in the Southern District of Florida.",
    "The document cites a significant increase in DOJ efforts against human trafficking and child exploitation from FY 2009-2016, including a near-doubling of child exploitation cases charged.",
    "The government argues that partial rescission of the 2007 NPA would harm some victims who value anonymity and have settled with Epstein, and could undermine benefits obtained by over a dozen victims.",
    "The government contends partial rescission has no basis in contract law because the NPA is an 'indivisible' agreement where the immunity provisions were the core consideration for Epstein's concessions.",
    "The document reveals a split among victims: some passionately want Epstein prosecuted and to testify, while others prioritize anonymity and do not want to participate in any litigation.",
    "The government states that granting partial rescission would perversely reward it for the CVRA violation by allowing it to keep the benefits of Epstein's compliance without being bound to its own commitments.",
    "The government argues the CVRA does not grant victims a right to access grand jury materials, government investigative files, or discovery from the criminal case, citing legal precedents.",
    "The brief asserts that any court order directing the government on future actions regarding Epstein's prosecution would violate separation of powers and prosecutorial discretion.",
    "The government claims the law enforcement investigative privilege protects FBI files to prevent harm, embarrassment, or psychological trauma to victims and to protect investigative methods.",
    "The document states the CVRA explicitly prohibits a cause of action for damages against the United States, barring victims' requests for monetary sanctions, attorneys' fees, or restitution from the government.",
    "The filing acknowledges the government's conduct in the Epstein matter 'fell short' of its dedication to serve victims, but endorses the government's own proposed remedies over those requested by the victims."
