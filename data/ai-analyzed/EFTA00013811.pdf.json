  "summary": "This document is a legal submission from Kirkland & Ellis LLP to the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, arguing against federal prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein. It contends Epstein's conduct (soliciting massages that sometimes involved sexual activity) was a state-level misdemeanor, not a federal crime under statutes 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b), or 2423(b). The submission cites Supreme Court rulings on statutory interpretation, argues the lack of interstate nexus, and claims victims lied about their ages. It requests the DOJ end federal involvement and let Florida handle the case.",
