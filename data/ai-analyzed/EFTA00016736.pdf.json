  "summary": "This is a letter from defense attorney Bruce Barket to Judge Kenneth K. Karas requesting an evidentiary hearing regarding the government's failure to preserve video surveillance footage from the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) that captured the hallway outside the cell shared by Nicholas Tartaglione and Jeffrey Epstein during Epstein's suicide attempt on July 23, 2019. The letter argues the footage would have been exculpatory for Tartaglione and criticizes the government's inconsistent explanations for its destruction.",
