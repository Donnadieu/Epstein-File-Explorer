    "Dr. concluded Jeffrey Epstein's cause of death was hanging and the manner was suicide, based on autopsy findings including a ligature furrow, petechial hemorrhages, and fractures of the thyroid cartilage and hyoid bone consistent with hanging.",
    "The medical examiner noted the absence of defensive wounds, struggle marks, or other trauma that would suggest homicide or an altercation.",
    "Toxicology tests showed no substances in Epstein's system at the time of death.",
    "There was confusion and inconsistency regarding which piece of material was the actual ligature used in the hanging, with at least two different potential \"nooses\" photographed at the scene.",
    "Dr. stated that no one attempted to coerce or bribe her into ruling Epstein's death a suicide, though she received unpleasant calls from Epstein's family who were unhappy with the determination."
