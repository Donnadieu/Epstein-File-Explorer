    "The FBI's Litigation Support Unit and a Special Agent from the New York Field Office's Child Exploitation/Human Trafficking squad coordinated the review.",
    "The primary concern for the FBI review was to ensure the report's release would not impact the FBI's '7A stance' (a legal position, likely related to confidentiality or privileges) or any ongoing investigations.",
