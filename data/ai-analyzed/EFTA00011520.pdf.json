    "The U.S. Attorney's Office confirms an active grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein for possible violations of federal laws against sex trafficking of minors (18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 1594(c)) and enticement of minors (18 U.S.C. § 2422(b)).",
    "The investigation is not publicly known, and the government is concerned that alerting Epstein or other subjects could cause them to destroy evidence or flee.",
    "The government seeks discovery materials from the civil lawsuit 'Jane Doe 43 v. Epstein, et al.,' which are held by the plaintiffs' law firm, Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP.",
    "The law firm is willing to comply with the grand jury subpoena but is constrained by a protective order from the civil case, prompting the government's request for a court order to modify it.",
    "The filing argues that avoiding embarrassment is not a valid reason to uphold confidentiality against a legitimate law enforcement need, especially for crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors."
