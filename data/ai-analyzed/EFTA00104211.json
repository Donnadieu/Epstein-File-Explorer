    "In early January 2020, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) was coordinating a response to a request from civil plaintiffs' attorney Robbie Kaplan for information related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "The response involved drafting a formal 'Touhy' letter, which outlines federal regulations governing the disclosure of information from government investigations for use in unrelated civil litigation.",
    "The email chain reveals internal SDNY coordination to have a civil division AUSA act as the point of contact for such requests, separating that role from the criminal AUSAs who might be dealing with the same alleged victims as witnesses.",
    "The drafted Touhy letter template cites legal privileges that could block disclosure, including the law enforcement privilege, which protects confidential sources, investigatory records, and investigative techniques.",
    "The correspondence indicates an anticipation of additional similar requests stemming from civil litigation by alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein."
