  "summary": "This is a legal filing by the plaintiff's attorneys (Panish Shea & Boyle) opposing Ghislaine Maxwell's motion to stay a civil lawsuit. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, accuses Maxwell of sexual abuse when she was a minor. The filing argues Maxwell's request for a stay is disingenuous, as she has actively participated in the litigation from jail, and that a stay would harm the plaintiff and the public interest.",

    "Ghislaine Maxwell was actively participating in the civil litigation from jail, including filing an answer, attending conferences, and propounding discovery, while simultaneously arguing a stay was needed due to the burden of litigating from incarceration.",
    "The plaintiff argues Maxwell's request for a stay is a tactic to gain an unfair advantage by obtaining information about the plaintiff while avoiding having to disclose information about herself.",
    "The document clarifies that victims participating in the 'Epstein Claims Resolution Program' are not required to stay their civil litigation, countering Maxwell's implication that the plaintiff must choose one avenue or the other.",
    "This civil case is presented as the only active litigation against Ghislaine Maxwell at the time, with others either stayed or dismissed.",
    "The abuse alleged against the plaintiff, Jane Doe, is stated to have begun when she was 14 years old, approximately 26 years prior to this filing."
