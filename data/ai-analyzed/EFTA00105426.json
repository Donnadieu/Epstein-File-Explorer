    "The emails reveal internal prosecutor frustration, with one stating Epstein 'was somehow allowed to commit suicide on a second try in two weeks by a branch of our government' and calling it 'Not a great year for BOP in the New York area.'",
    "The prosecutors acknowledge the need for justice for Epstein's victims, with one writing 'His victims deserve some sort of modicum of justice and this is not how it should have gone down.'",
    "The prosecutors discuss the possibility of pursuing civil forfeiture against Epstein's properties but note they must check if they are within the statute of limitations.",
    "The emails state that a 'general money judgment against the estate' is not possible, but note Epstein has a living brother.",
    "The document is a candid, internal reaction from law enforcement officials to Epstein's death, highlighting their view of it as a systemic failure."
