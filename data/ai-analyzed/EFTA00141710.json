    "The investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's death was described as extremely complex, with high public and press interest causing major challenges from the start.",
    "Information flow was a significant problem; simultaneous interviews by different agents/AUSAs meant interviewers often lacked the most current information, leading to witnesses being interviewed multiple times.",
    "Investigators conducted numerous re-interviews in 2021-2022, finding that witnesses often disputed their prior statements from 2019, requiring clarification and follow-up on missed topics.",
    "Investigators faced obstructive behavior from some witnesses and their union representatives, and had to deal with conspiracy theories from Epstein's family members.",
    "A critical method was using documentary evidence (count slips, round sheets, emails) during interviews to identify inaccuracies, false entries, and employee job failures."
