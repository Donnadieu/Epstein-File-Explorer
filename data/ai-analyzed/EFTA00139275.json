  "summary": "This document is a compilation of daily lieutenant's logs from the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York, NY, for August 7, 2019. It details routine operational activities, inmate counts, movements, and administrative actions across three shifts (Morning, Day, and Evening Watch). The logs are significant as they provide a detailed snapshot of the facility's operations on a day when Jeffrey Epstein was incarcerated there, though he is not explicitly mentioned in these entries.",
