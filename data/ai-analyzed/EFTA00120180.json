    "Jeffrey Epstein was placed on suicide watch upon his arrival at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on July 8, 2019, due to risk factors including his sex offense charge, high-profile case, and pretrial status.",
    "On July 23, 2019, Epstein was found with a string hanging around his neck, leading to his placement back on suicide watch. He later told staff his cellmate tried to kill him, but during assessments claimed he could not remember the incident, at one point attributing it to 'sleep apnea.'",
    "A note from the court on August 1, 2019, indicated Epstein had 'suicidal tendencies,' but during a subsequent assessment he denied being suicidal, stated suicide was against his religion, and emphasized he was fighting his case.",
    "Throughout the documented period, Epstein repeatedly requested to be moved to general population and to be celled alone if housed in SHU, requests that were not granted.",
    "The memorandum documents a pattern of Epstein denying any psychological concerns, suicidal ideation, or mental health history during official assessments, while reporting correctional issues like noise, lack of a spoon, and wearing an orange jumpsuit."
