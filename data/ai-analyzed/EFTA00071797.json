  "summary": "This document is an email chain between Assistant U.S. Attorneys in the Southern District of New York discussing two research projects related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The first project involves locating a government filing that argues the Epstein Non-Prosecution Agreement does not prevent prosecution in other federal districts. The second project involves researching case law on whether 18 U.S.C. § 1591 (sex trafficking statute) applied to purchasers (consumers/johns) prior to its 2015 amendment.",

    "The government argued in a 2011 motion that the Epstein Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) 'does not bar the United States from bringing federal criminal charges against Epstein for the offenses set forth in the Non-Prosecution Agreement in any other district in this nation.'",
    "A judge recently found that the Southern District of Florida (SDFL) violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act in litigation related to Epstein.",
    "The research project includes analyzing whether the pre-2015 version of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 applied to purchasers (consumers/johns) of commercial sex acts, with cited cases showing conflicting interpretations.",
    "The key case cited for applying § 1591 to consumers is United States v. Jungers (8th Cir. 2013), which held the statute's 'unambiguous text... makes no distinction between suppliers and purchasers.'",
    "A contrary case, Fierro v. Taylor (S.D.N.Y. 2012), held the statute was 'meant to punish those who are the providers or pimps of children, not the purchasers or the johns.'"
