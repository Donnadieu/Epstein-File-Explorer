    "Maxwell's defense states she has waived her right to contest extradition from the United Kingdom and France, with expert opinions stating extradition from those countries would be likely and prompt.",
    "The document claims Maxwell was not hiding from law enforcement but was protecting herself from a media frenzy and physical threats following Epstein's arrest and death.",
    "Maxwell's defense criticizes her detention conditions at the MDC as 'oppressive' and 'de facto solitary confinement,' impairing her ability to prepare her defense."
