    "In June 2020, the U.S. DOJ reportedly made a formal MLAT request to the UK government to question Prince Andrew as part of the Jeffrey Epstein criminal investigation.",
    "Prince Andrew's lawyers publicly accused the DOJ of mishandling his offers to cooperate, claiming he had offered to help 'at least three occasions this year' and that statements by U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman were 'inaccurate.'",
    "U.S. officials internally debated press strategy, weighing the downsides of a public dispute against the desire to correct the record and clarify that the MLAT request was a 'last choice.'",
    "The sensitivity of the request was heightened by parallel tensions in U.S.-UK relations, specifically the UK's request for the extradition of Anne Sacoolas and Prince Andrew's royal status.",
    "The standard U.S. government press posture was to not confirm or deny the existence of investigations or MLAT requests, but officials considered deviating from this to respond to the lawyers' allegations."
