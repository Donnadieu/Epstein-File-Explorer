    "The defense claims Ghislaine Maxwell is being held under uniquely restrictive conditions at MDC, including 24/7 surveillance by a three-guard detail and two cameras, weekly body scans, 15-minute flashlight checks at night, and open-mouth inspections.",
    "The defense alleges decisions about Maxwell's specialized detention are made by the MDC Warden or by individuals outside the MDC, and that a report from MDC legal counsel would only provide second-hand information.",
    "The government counters that Maxwell has more time to review discovery than any other MDC inmate and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her attorneys.",
    "The parties could not reach an agreement; the government wants a written response from MDC legal counsel, while the defense demands a personal appearance by the MDC Warden before the court.",
    "The document reveals ongoing legal disputes over Maxwell's pretrial detention conditions, highlighting her status as a high-profile inmate with specialized security measures."
