  "summary": "This is the U.S. Government's omnibus memorandum in opposition to Ghislaine Maxwell's thirteen motions in limine in her criminal case (S2 20 Cr. 330). It argues for the admissibility of expert testimony on trauma psychology, evidence related to Minor Victim-3, co-conspirator statements, identification evidence, and various exhibits, while also addressing defense motions to preclude terms like 'victim' and evidence of rape. The document outlines the prosecution's trial strategy and legal arguments.",
