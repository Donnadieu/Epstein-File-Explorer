    "The witness states that internal daily court/transfer rosters are printed, distributed, and then discarded/deleted daily, with no long-term retention, making it difficult to reconstruct what was documented about Tartaglione's transfer.",
    "The witness denies any knowledge of an inmate being placed on a 'dry cell' watch in the R&D area on August 9, 2019, stating they would not allow it as R&D does not watch inmates.",
    "The witness heard rumors about staff not conducting rounds/counts and falsifying records but has no firsthand knowledge, and suggests more training and staffing as systemic issues that may have contributed to Epstein's death."
