    "The petition reveals active federal plea negotiations between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office in July 2008, concurrent with his state court guilty plea.",
    "It alleges specific federal crimes against the petitioner: sex trafficking of children by fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1591), enticement of a minor for prostitution using interstate commerce (18 U.S.C. § 2422), and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343).",
    "The document argues victims have CVRA rights, including the right to confer with prosecutors, even during the investigative phase before formal charges are filed.",
    "It cites a recent Fifth Circuit case (In re Dean) holding that the government violated the CVRA by negotiating a plea deal without conferring with victims.",
    "The filing indicates the petitioner and 'several other young females' were victims of 'roughly the same crimes,' suggesting multiple victims in the federal investigation."
