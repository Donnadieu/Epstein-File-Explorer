  "summary": "This is a memorandum opinion and order by Judge Alison J. Nathan regarding Ghislaine Maxwell's fourth motion in limine to exclude testimony from 'Witness-3' (Accuser-3). The court rules that portions of the witness's testimony are admissible as direct evidence for Mann Act counts and for permissible purposes under Rule 404(b), but imposes strict limitations to prevent unfair prejudice under Rule 403. The order includes proposed limiting instructions for the jury. This is a transcript of a pre-trial hearing in a criminal case (Case 1:20-cr-00084-AJN) before a judge. The discussion centers on the admissibility of testimony from witness Rasheen Vega regarding the victim's (Mr. Jones) medical condition and injuries following a shooting. The defense objects to graphic descriptions of bedsores and suffering, arguing it is prejudicial, while the prosecution argues it is necessary to establish causation of death. The judge sets limits on the testimony.",

    "Witness-3 is expected to testify that Maxwell introduced her to Epstein, massages progressed to sexual activity, Maxwell provided a schoolgirl uniform, and Maxwell asked her to find other girls for Epstein.",
    "The court imposed strict limits on the testimony: Witness-3 can state sexual activity occurred but cannot provide detailed descriptions, subjective experiences, or emotional impact, to minimize prejudice under Rule 403.",
    "The government is prohibited from referring to Witness-3 as a 'victim' or 'minor victim' in front of the jury, as she was over the age of consent and not a victim of the charged crimes.",
    "The court provided proposed limiting instructions for the jury, emphasizing that Witness-3's sexual conduct with Epstein was not illegal for the purposes of the indictment and cannot form the basis for conviction.",
    "The case involves a shooting from June 2000 where the victim, Mr. Jones, was paralyzed and later died in November 2010 from complications.",
    "A key issue is establishing legal causation—proving the shooting directly led to the victim's death a decade later via paraplegia, bedsores, and infection.",
    "The defense strongly objects to the nephew's (Rasheen Vega) graphic, non-expert testimony about oozing wounds and odor, arguing it is unduly prejudicial and meant to elicit jury sympathy.",
    "The prosecution argues the testimony is crucial to connect the victim's post-shooting condition to his death, as medical experts did not observe him during the intervening decade.",
    "The judge rules to allow limited, non-gratuitous testimony from Vega about the injuries but will strictly guard against overly emotional or graphic descriptions that could prejudice the jury."
