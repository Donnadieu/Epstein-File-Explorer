    "The retired Regional Director stated that not providing Epstein with a cellmate and failure to conduct proper rounds/counts were the two main factors that led to his suicide.",
    "MCC had replacement camera equipment since October 2018 but hadn't installed it before Epstein's death in August 2019, despite known system failures.",
    "Epstein was given an unmonitored phone call on August 9, 2019, where he claimed to call his deceased mother; a male answered the phone.",
    "The after-action report indicated multiple staff knew Epstein required a cellmate, but no fail-safe system ensured this requirement was met after his initial cellmate was transferred.",
    "The witness acknowledged the political nature of the investigation, noting there were 'a dozen suicides that year' but only Epstein's was being investigated."
