  "summary": "This is the official transcript of the teleconference arraignment, initial scheduling conference, and bail hearing for Ghislaine Maxwell before Judge Alison J. Nathan on July 14, 2020. The defendant pleads not guilty to the superseding indictment. The government argues for pretrial detention based on extreme risk of flight, citing Maxwell's financial resources, international ties, and alleged efforts to conceal herself. Defense counsel argues for release on strict conditions. Judge Nathan orders Maxwell detained pending trial, finding the government met its burden to show she is a flight risk and no conditions could reasonably assure her appearance.",
