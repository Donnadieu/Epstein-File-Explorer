  "summary": "This is a formal complaint filed by attorney Paul G. Cassell on behalf of Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2, alleging that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Puerto Rico violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act by failing to respond to requests regarding an investigation into a former Assistant U.S. Attorney who allegedly filed a false statement in a prior CVRA case in the Southern District of Florida. The complaint details unreturned phone calls and letters to the office. This document is a March 3, 2014 letter from attorney Paul G. Cassell to U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer, renewing a request for a criminal investigation into former Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce E. Reinhart. Cassell alleges Reinhart filed a false affidavit in a Crime Victims' Rights Act case related to Jeffrey Epstein and later represented Epstein associates, suggesting improper influence on the Epstein non-prosecution agreement. An attached January 20, 2016 letter shows follow-up to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Puerto Rico regarding the stalled investigation.",
