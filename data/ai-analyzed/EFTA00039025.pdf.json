  "summary": "This is the Office of the Inspector General's report investigating the Federal Bureau of Prisons' custody, care, and supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York from his arrest on July 6, 2019, until his death by suicide on August 10, 2019. The report details numerous and serious failures by BOP staff, including falsification of records, failure to assign a cellmate, failure to conduct required rounds and counts, and allowing an unmonitored phone call, which created an environment where Epstein could take his own life. The OIG found no evidence contradicting the FBI's determination that his death was a suicide. This is the Office of the Inspector General's (OIG) official draft report on the Federal Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) care, custody, and supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York. It contains eight recommendations for BOP policy changes following Epstein's death, along with the BOP's responses and the OIG's analysis of those responses.",
