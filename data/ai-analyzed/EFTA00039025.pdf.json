  "summary": "This is the Office of the Inspector General's report investigating the Federal Bureau of Prisons' custody, care, and supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York leading up to his death by suicide on August 10, 2019. The report details numerous policy violations, falsification of records, and failures by BOP staff that created an environment where Epstein was left unmonitored and alone in his cell, enabling his suicide. This is the Office of the Inspector General's (OIG) official draft report on the Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) care, custody, and supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York. It contains eight recommendations for BOP policy changes following Epstein's death, along with the BOP's responses and the OIG's analysis of those responses.",
