    "The OIG report states that BOP employees failed to ensure Jeffrey Epstein continuously had a cellmate, despite Psychology Department personnel determining he needed one.",
    "The BOP concurred with all eight OIG recommendations aimed at improving inmate supervision, suicide watch procedures, staffing, and security systems.",
    "The report indicates that the issues leading to Epstein's death were due to employees failing to adhere to duties, not staffing shortages.",
    "The OIG analysis found the BOP's response to Recommendation 2 (ensuring high-risk inmates keep a cellmate) was 'not fully responsive' and required further action.",
    "The BOP has updated its processes related to suicide watch and psychological observation since Epstein's death, implementing a more individualized approach."
