  "summary": "This is the Office of the Inspector General's report on its investigation into the Federal Bureau of Prisons' custody, care, and supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. It details the failures and misconduct by BOP staff that contributed to Epstein being alone and unmonitored in his cell, leading to his suicide on August 10, 2019. The report concludes that while staff engaged in significant policy violations and falsified records, there was no evidence contradicting the FBI's determination that Epstein's death was a suicide. This is the Office of the Inspector General's (OIG) official draft report on the Federal Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) care, custody, and supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York. It details eight recommendations for BOP policy changes following Epstein's death, includes the BOP's responses concurring with all recommendations, and provides the OIG's analysis of those responses.",
