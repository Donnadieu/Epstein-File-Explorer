    "The government served a 'Maxwell Rule 404(b) letter' on October 11, 2021, referencing emails between Maxwell and 'influential' men about setting up dates and a witness who worked for Epstein from 2005-2006.",
    "The defense argues the government's notice failed to identify specific evidence, articulate non-propensity purposes, or provide reasoning as required by the amended Rule 404(b).",
    "The motion reveals the government provided approximately 400 pages of materials related to a newly disclosed witness on October 12, 2021.",
    "The defense claims the government's notice references evidence from after the charged conspiracy period (which allegedly ended in 2004), including flight logs from 2005-2013 and financial statements from 2007.",
    "Maxwell's attorneys request exclusion of the evidence or, alternatively, additional time to investigate and respond to the government's notice."
