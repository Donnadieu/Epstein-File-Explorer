The order details the court's reasoning, reaffirming that Maxwell poses a significant flight risk due to her substantial international ties, financial resources, and lack of candor, and that no combination of proposed conditions, including renouncing citizenship and asset monitoring, can reasonably assure her appearance.",

    "Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted on charges of conspiracy to entice minors, transporting minors for illegal sex acts, and perjury.",
    "The court has repeatedly denied bail, finding Maxwell a significant flight risk due to her international ties (French and British citizenship), substantial financial resources, and lack of candor about her assets.",
    "Maxwell's third bail proposal included renouncing her French and British citizenship and having a retired federal judge monitor her and her spouse's assets.",
    "The court found considerable legal uncertainty about whether renouncing citizenship would prevent France from refusing extradition, as nationality may be assessed at the time the offense was committed.",
    "The court determined that even with the proposed asset monitor, Maxwell would retain access to substantial funds (e.g., $450,000 for living expenses) sufficient to facilitate flight."
