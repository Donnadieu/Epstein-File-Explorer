    "The death of Jeffrey Epstein raised a specific legal question from prosecutors about whether the concerns over the subpoena 'continue after Epstein's death'.",

    "Amazon indicated it was preserving responsive information and might file a motion to quash the subpoena if the government pursued the request for expressive materials."
