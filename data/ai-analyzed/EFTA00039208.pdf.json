    "This is a standard Bureau of Prisons policy document on inmate search procedures, not a case-specific record related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "The policy rescinds a prior 1997 version and includes updated regulations concerning electronic searches, x-rays, and cross-gender searches.",
    "It explicitly restricts cross-gender pat-down searches of female inmates, in accordance with the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), except under exigent circumstances.",
    "The document details procedures for 'dry cell' status (close observation) used when an inmate is suspected of ingesting or concealing contraband in a body cavity.",
    "It outlines the hierarchy of approval required for more intrusive search methods, such as medical x-rays or digital/instrument searches."
