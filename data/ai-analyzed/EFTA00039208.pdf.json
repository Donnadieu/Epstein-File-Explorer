    "This is a standard Bureau of Prisons policy document (P5521.06) on inmate search procedures, dated June 4, 2015, effective July 6, 2015.",
    "The policy explicitly restricts cross-gender pat-down searches of female inmates, in accordance with the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), allowing them only under 'exigent circumstances' which require immediate action to combat a security threat.",
    "It details procedures for 'dry cell' status (close observation), used when there is reasonable belief an inmate has ingested or concealed contraband in a body cavity and other search methods are inappropriate.",
    "The policy outlines a hierarchy of search methods from least to most intrusive: electronic, pat, visual, digital/simple instrument, and finally medical x-ray or surgical intrusion, which require high-level authorization.",
    "The document was approved by Charles E. Samuels, Jr., the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons at the time."
