    "The document is a procedural notice from a Nevada court regarding a filing error, not a substantive document related to the Epstein case.",
    "The case (D-20-606708-L) involved Carmit Pesia Cipolla as plaintiff and Giuseppe Cipolla as defendant and was closed due to a nonconforming motion.",
    "The nonconforming motion was titled 'Motion to Correct Clerical Mistake (Upside down)' and was filed by Carmit Cipolla on April 17, 2020.",
    "The case was designated as 'filed in error' and stricken from the record because the document did not properly initiate a civil action and lacked a required hearing designation.",
    "The document's inclusion in the Epstein case data set (EFTA00151195) appears to be incidental or an error in document collection, as it contains no references to Jeffrey Epstein, his associates, victims, or related entities."
