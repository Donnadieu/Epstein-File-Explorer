    "On August 16, 2019, a new Warden at MCC New York implemented highly centralized procedures for inmate suicide and psychological watch.",
    "The Warden demanded to be called directly, at any time of day, whenever an inmate was placed on or taken off suicide watch or psychological observation.",
    "The Warden reserved sole decision-making authority for approving the use of inmate companions (as opposed to staff) to watch at-risk inmates.",
    "This procedural change occurred just days before Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in his cell at the same facility on August 10, 2019 (note: the document date is August 16, 2019, which is after Epstein's death; this may indicate post-incident procedural review or the date is an error in the context)."
