    "The witness confirms that Epstein was required to have a cellmate per a 'hot list' generated by Psychology, especially after his first suicide attempt. An email from Psychology/Captain reiterated this requirement.",
    "Epstein's cellmate, Efrain Reyes, was transferred out of MCC (With All Belongings) at 8:38 a.m. on August 9, 2019. Despite a memo from SOS stating he passed this information to oncoming staff, no action was taken to assign Epstein a new cellmate, and the witness (the Ops Lieutenant that evening) was not informed.",
    "The witness states that SHU officers are supposed to conduct rounds every 30 minutes, and lieutenants are supposed to verify these rounds by signing round sheets located downrange. He expresses confusion and lack of recollection about his own signature appearing on the round sheet for L tier (Epstein's tier) for August 9, 2019, insisting he did not make rounds in SHU that night.",
    "The interview reveals significant discrepancies in count paperwork for the SHU on the night of August 9-10, 2019, including count slips marked with '+1' (which the witness had never seen before) and mismatched numbers between E-1 forms, count slips, and the lieutenant's daily log, suggesting possible falsification or ghost counting.",
    "The witness attributes systemic failures leading to Epstein's death to severe staff exhaustion and chronic understaffing at MCC, with officers working excessive overtime (16-hour shifts, mandated multiple days in a row), leading to them being 'zombies' and potentially unable to perform duties properly."
