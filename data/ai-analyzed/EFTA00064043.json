    "On August 9, 2019, the day before Epstein's death, the MCC's camera recording system failed, with approximately 50-60 cameras not recording, including nearly all cameras in the SHU except one (the '46 door' camera outside 10 South).",
    "The electronics technician stated the system was outdated, had failed multiple times before, and needed upgrades that had been ordered but not yet installed. He notified a supervisor of the failure on August 9 but was told to go home and fix it the next day.",
    "During the response to Epstein's body alarm on August 10, inmates in the SHU shouted at officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, saying 'You killed him' and 'You didn't do any rounds all night.'",
    "The technician believed Epstein's death was a suicide and that the camera failure was coincidental, stating no one could have tampered with the system due to physical security measures.",
    "The FBI took all hard drives and the recording system the day after Epstein's death, but according to the technician, there was likely no recoverable video from the failed drives."
