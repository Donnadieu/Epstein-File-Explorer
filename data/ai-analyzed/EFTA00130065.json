  "summary": "This document contains the official autopsy report and toxicology report for Jeffrey Edward Epstein from the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner. The autopsy was performed on August 11, 2019, and the cause of death is listed as hanging, with the manner of death ruled as suicide. The toxicology report shows no drugs or alcohol were detected in his system. This document is a collection of reports from the NYC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner related to the autopsy and death investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. It includes toxicology results (negative for synthetic cannabinoids), neuropathology findings (normal brain), anthropology findings (fractures to hyoid and thyroid cartilage), and a detailed investigation report describing the scene and circumstances of his death in the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC). These are internal case notes from the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner documenting the death investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. The notes detail the autopsy process, evidence collection, communication with Epstein's family attorney and brother, and coordination with the FBI and NYPD. They reveal the family's request for a private pathologist to observe the autopsy and the medical examiner's communication about amending the death certificate. This document contains the official Notice of Death for Jeffrey Epstein, mortuary release paperwork, and an FBI interview summary with an MCC Lieutenant regarding the circumstances of Epstein's death. It details the discovery of Epstein unresponsive in his cell, the response, and reveals potential policy violations regarding inmate checks and cellmate requirements. This document is a compilation of Bureau of Prisons records detailing Jeffrey Epstein's self-mutilation incident in July 2019 and his subsequent death by suicide in August 2019 at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York. It includes incident reports, a detailed timeline of the suicide and response, memoranda from staff, chain of custody logs for evidence recovered from his cell, and administrative worksheets related to the crime scene investigation.",
