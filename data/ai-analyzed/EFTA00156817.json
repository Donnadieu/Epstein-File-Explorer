  "summary": "This document is an academic systematic review article titled 'Responding to Delayed Disclosure of Sexual Assault in Health Settings', published in the journal Trauma, Violence, & Abuse. It analyzes literature on how healthcare providers respond to delayed disclosures of sexual assault by adolescent and adult female survivors. The document itself is not a primary case file but appears in the Epstein dataset, possibly as background research material. This document is a table and analysis from a research article reviewing 23 studies on how sexual assault survivors disclose to healthcare providers and the providers' responses. It summarizes helpful and unhelpful responses, disclosure rates, and recommendations for medical professionals. It is not directly about the Epstein case but appears to be part of a larger document or research compilation. This document is an excerpt from an academic literature review article titled 'Trauma, Violence, & Abuse' analyzing research on how formal support providers, including health-care providers, respond to disclosures of past sexual assault. It synthesizes findings from multiple studies on helpful and unhelpful responses, and provides recommendations for health-care providers. It does not contain specific case information about Jeffrey Epstein or his associates. This document is an academic literature review article titled 'Lanthier et al. 13' (likely a citation error for 'Lanthier et al. 15'), focusing on healthcare responses to disclosures of past sexual assault. It discusses barriers to disclosure, the importance of supportive responses from healthcare providers, and provides implications for practice, policy, and research. It is not a primary legal or investigative document related to the Epstein case, but appears to be a scholarly paper included in a document set, possibly as background material or an exhibit.",
