  "summary": "This is a letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York to Judge Alison J. Nathan opposing Ghislaine Maxwell's defense request to adjourn her July 12, 2021 trial date. The government argues the defense has sufficient time to prepare for the superseding indictment (S2 Indictment), which focuses on four victims, and that delay would harm the victims. It also requests that if an adjournment is granted, the trial be rescheduled for March 2022 to ensure continuity of prosecution counsel.",
