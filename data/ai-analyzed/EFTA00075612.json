    "The court denied Ghislaine Maxwell's request for immediate disclosure of the identities of the three alleged victims referenced in the indictment, calling the request premature.",
    "The court denied Maxwell's request for an order directing BOP to release her into general population and provide increased access to discovery materials, noting BOP was already providing 13 hours/day, 7 days/week access.",
    "The court ordered the Government to provide written status updates every 90 days detailing any material changes to Maxwell's confinement conditions, particularly regarding access to legal materials and ability to communicate with counsel.",
    "The Government assured the court that Maxwell can speak to her counsel behind a closed door in an area visible but not audible to MDC staff.",
    "The court found no basis to conclude that surveillance measures imposed on Maxwell were punitive rather than for security purposes."
