    "The FBI was actively investigating Ghislaine Maxwell in June 2020 for potential violations of sex trafficking (18 U.S.C. § 1591), conspiracy (18 U.S.C. § 371), and related statutes.",
    "The investigation sought to surveil a phone line subscribed under the name 'G Max', strongly suggesting it was used by Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "The surveillance authorized was a pen register/trap-and-trace device, which captures metadata (phone numbers, IP addresses, dates, times, durations) but not the content of communications.",
    "The order was sealed to prevent disclosure of the investigation to the target subjects, indicating the covert nature of this phase of the probe."
