    "The U.S. government obtained a sealed court order in October 2019 to secretly subpoena Google for all records associated with Ghislaine Maxwell, preventing her from being notified for at least 180 days.",
    "The investigation underlying the subpoena was for suspected violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591 (sex trafficking) and 371 (conspiracy), indicating a focus on federal sex trafficking crimes.",
    "The subpoena sought a vast array of digital records, including subscriber info, payment details, call/SMS records, IP history, and customer service communications linked to Maxwell.",
    "The government argued that disclosure of the subpoena could jeopardize the investigation by allowing targets to flee, tamper with evidence, or intimidate witnesses.",
    "The document shows the covert, methodical steps taken by federal investigators to gather evidence against Maxwell while keeping the investigation secret from her."
