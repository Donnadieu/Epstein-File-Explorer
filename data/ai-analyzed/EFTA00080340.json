    "The specific purpose of the visit was to inspect the 'psych observation and suicide watch area,' the '9th floor SHU,' and 'Epstein's cell, which we understand to still be cordoned off.'",
    "The visiting officials explicitly requested to be escorted only by MCC legal staff and stated they 'will not speak to any of the guards present given the ongoing investigations,' indicating sensitivity around the Epstein case.",
    "The visit was to include high-level DOJ officials: US Attorney Geoffrey Berman and Principal Deputy Attorney General Ed O'Callahan, among others.",
    "The correspondence shows careful coordination of logistics and security for the visit, including screening in the front lobby and a potential entry via a '3rd floor bridge.'"
