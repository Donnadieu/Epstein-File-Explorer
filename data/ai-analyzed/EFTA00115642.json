  "keyFacts": [
    "The retired BOP Regional Director had limited recollection of specific events from August 2019, citing the passage of time and the political nature of the Epstein investigation compared to other inmate suicides.",
    "Key failures identified include: Epstein not being housed with a cellmate after Reyes left, and staff not conducting required rounds and counts on the night of August 9-10, 2019.",
    "The MCC's camera system in the SHU was not recording prior to Epstein's death. Replacement parts had been on site for nearly a year but were not installed until after the incident.",
    "Epstein made an unmonitored, unlogged social phone call on August 9, 2019, on a legal line, claiming he wanted to call his deceased mother. A man answered the phone.",
    "The BOP's after-action report concluded that having a cellmate significantly lowers the odds of suicide, and a failure occurred by allowing Epstein to be in a cell alone."
