    "Judge Engelmayer ordered the BOP to explain why Ghislaine Maxwell received superior accommodations (13 hours/day laptop access, 15 hours/week video calls) compared to Justin Rivera (initially 3 hours/day laptop, 6 hours/week video calls).",
    "The rationale provided for the disparity centered on Maxwell's unique protective custody housing at MDC versus Rivera's general population housing at MCC, affecting shared resource availability.",
    "The MCC subsequently began leaving a laptop with Rivera all day, only taking it at night to charge, effectively matching Maxwell's electronic discovery access.",
    "Defense counsel for Rivera suggested the disparities were due to race, gender, and class, which the judge acknowledged created 'terrible' optics.",
    "The email chain involves coordination between the U.S. Attorney's Office and BOP officials to draft declarations from associate wardens at MDC and MCC by a tight deadline."
