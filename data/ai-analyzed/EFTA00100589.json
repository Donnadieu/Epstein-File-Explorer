    "In June 2020, the U.S. government obtained a sealed court order to conduct electronic surveillance (pen register/trap-and-trace) on a phone line subscribed under the name 'G Max', which is strongly implied to belong to Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "The surveillance was authorized as part of an active FBI investigation into Maxwell and others for potential violations of federal sex trafficking, conspiracy, and transportation statutes (18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 371, 2423(a), 2422).",
    "The order specifically authorized the collection of metadata (phone numbers, IP addresses, communication ports, date, time, duration) but not the contents of any communications.",
    "The application and order were filed under seal to prevent disclosure of the investigation to the target subjects."
