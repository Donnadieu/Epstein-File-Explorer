    "There was a discrepancy of 31 files between the SDNY011 production (40,567 files) and the non-nude index (40,536 entries), attributed to Excel and PDF files not included in the index.",
    "The defense reported that hash values in the government's overlay file did not match the index, preventing proper correlation of metadata to produced native files.",
    "Ghislaine Maxwell's ability to review discovery at the MDC was severely hampered, as many photo files were unreadable on her laptop and the load file format was problematic.",
    "The defense challenged the 'highly confidential' designation of nude/partially-nude adult photos, noting they did not appear to constitute child pornography, and requested better access for review."
