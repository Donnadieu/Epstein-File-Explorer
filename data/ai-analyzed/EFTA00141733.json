    "The OIG's June 2023 report made eight specific recommendations to the BOP to address failures related to the supervision of Jeffrey Epstein, who died in custody.",
    "All eight recommendations remain 'Resolved' as of this April 2024 update, meaning the BOP has reported responsive actions but the OIG has not yet closed them pending review of finalized policies.",
    "Key recommendations focus on procedures for assigning cellmates after suicide watch, ensuring high-risk inmates have cellmates, improving inmate whereabouts accounting, clarifying Lieutenant round duties, addressing staffing shortages, evaluating cell search procedures, and enhancing security camera policies.",
    "The BOP is drafting or updating multiple policy manuals (Correctional Services Procedures Manual, Facilities Operations Manual) and developing an automated staffing tool in response to the recommendations.",
    "The document reveals systemic issues within BOP procedures for suicide prevention, inmate monitoring, and staffing that were highlighted by the Epstein case."
