    "The interview is part of the official DOJ OIG investigation into the death of Jeffrey Epstein and surrounding circumstances at the MCC.",

    "The 'call-out' list for inmate movements is created in the SENTRY system, printed, and disseminated, but is typically deleted and recreated daily, making historical records difficult to obtain.",
    "The BOP uses a 'chit' (C-H-I-T) system for key and equipment accountability, not a sign-out log. Each officer has personalized chits they exchange for equipment."
