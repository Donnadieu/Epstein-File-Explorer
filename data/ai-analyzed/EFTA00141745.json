    "The OIG's 2023 report made eight recommendations to the BOP following its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's custody and death; one recommendation was previously closed, and the remaining seven are currently 'Resolved' pending final policy implementation.",
    "The BOP is in the process of revising multiple Program Statements (5321.09, 5324.08, 5500.14, 4200.12) to address recommendations on cellmate assignment, suicide watch procedures, inmate monitoring, and security camera systems, but these revisions are subject to union negotiation.",
    "The BOP reported notable improvements in staff retention rates (overall and for Correctional Officers and Nurse Practitioners) due to incentives outlined in a 2023 'Incentives Playbook,' but is now reducing or eliminating those incentives due to budgetary constraints as of March 23, 2025.",
    "The BOP has requested over $1.5 billion in funding from Congress to increase Correctional Officer positions by 4,500 and nurse positions by 200 over the next five years, based on projections from a new Automated Staffing Tool.",
    "The OIG will not close the recommendations until the BOP finalizes the referenced policy revisions and provides them for OIG review, and provides further updates on staffing incentives, congressional reports, and salary proposals to OPM."
