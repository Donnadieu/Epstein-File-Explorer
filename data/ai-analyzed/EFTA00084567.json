  "summary": "This is a letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York to Judge Alison J. Nathan regarding the proposed protective order in the case against Ghislaine Maxwell. The government opposes two key modifications requested by the defense: (1) allowing the defense to publicly name victims who have ever spoken publicly about Epstein or Maxwell, and (2) imposing restrictions on the government's use of its own investigative materials. The government argues for protecting victim privacy under the Crime Victims' Rights Act. This is a proposed protective order filed in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell (20 Cr. 330). It establishes strict rules for handling discovery materials provided by the government, including confidential and highly confidential information (the latter containing sexualized images/videos), to protect victim/witness privacy and prevent prejudicial pretrial publicity.",

    "The government strongly opposes the defense's request to be allowed to publicly name any victim who has ever spoken about Epstein or Maxwell in any public forum, calling the request 'extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate.'",
    "The government argues victim identities must be protected under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (18 U.S.C. § 3771) to ensure dignity, privacy, and safety, and to encourage other victims to come forward.",
    "The government's proposed order would allow the defense to use victim names in sealed filings and private investigative conversations, and to publicly name only those victims who choose to identify themselves on the record in *this* specific case.",
    "The government also opposes the defense's unprecedented request to restrict how the government uses its own investigative documents with witnesses, stating such restrictions have no legal basis and conflict with existing laws like FOIA.",
    "The document reveals a strategic conflict where the defense seeks wide latitude to discuss victims publicly, while the government seeks to tightly control such disclosures to protect victim welfare.",
    "The protective order categorizes discovery materials, with 'Highly Confidential Information' explicitly defined as containing 'nude, partially-nude, or otherwise sexualized images, videos, or other depictions of individuals.'",
    "The order strictly prohibits the public disclosure of victim and witness identities referenced in the discovery, except for those who have already identified themselves publicly on the record.",
    "The defendant (Maxwell) is restricted in how she can access sensitive materials, requiring her to review 'Highly Confidential Information' solely in the presence of her defense counsel.",
    "The order aims to protect ongoing investigations, prevent prejudicial pretrial publicity, and safeguard the privacy of individuals mentioned in the discovery materials."
