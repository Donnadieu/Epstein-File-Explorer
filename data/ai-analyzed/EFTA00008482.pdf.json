    "The document is a chain of custody form for electronic surveillance (ELSUR) evidence, Case File # 76-04-3)59.5q9.",
    "The evidence type appears to be related to FISA, consensual monitoring, or Title III/PRTT intercepts, though specific boxes are checked in a way that is not fully clear.",
    "The form includes multiple signature blocks for tracking evidence handling, but the printed names and signatures are largely illegible or redacted.",
    "A download date of '13' and time of '1995' are noted, though this may be a misinterpretation of handwritten text (e.g., '19:95' for 7:95 PM).",
    "The document reference EFTA00008482 suggests it is part of the Epstein case document release, indicating intercepted communications may have been collected as evidence."
