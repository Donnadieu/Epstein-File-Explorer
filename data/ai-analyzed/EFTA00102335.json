  "summary": "This is a transcript of a court proceeding, likely a pre-trial hearing in the Ghislaine Maxwell case, where the judge rules on government motions. The judge denies the defense's motion to preclude the term 'victim' and grants the government's motion to allow eight witnesses and alleged victims to testify using pseudonyms or first names to protect their privacy and prevent harassment. The judge also addresses logistics for voir dire and the handling of exhibits.",

    "The judge ruled that the government may use the term 'victim' to represent its litigating position, finding defense arguments unpersuasive.",
    "The judge granted the government's motion to allow eight individuals (alleged victims and related witnesses) to be referred to by pseudonyms or first names during the trial to protect their privacy and prevent harassment.",
    "The defense is aware of the real identities of all eight individuals, and the jury will also be made aware; the pseudonyms are only for open court references.",
    "The judge ordered the parties to submit a joint proposal by November 10 for the pseudonym nomenclature and a limiting instruction for the jury regarding the privacy precautions.",
    "The judge emphasized that the defense's right to cross-examine witnesses would not be unduly limited by the use of pseudonyms, though specific identifying information (employer names, addresses) should be withheld."
