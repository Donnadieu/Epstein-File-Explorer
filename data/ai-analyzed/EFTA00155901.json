  "summary": "This is a motion filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team for a new trial, arguing that Juror No. 50 (Scotty David) committed misconduct by falsely denying on his jury questionnaire and during voir dire that he had been a victim of sexual abuse. The motion contends that the juror's subsequent media interviews revealed he used his personal experience to influence other jurors, depriving Maxwell of her right to an impartial jury. The document also references a second, unidentified juror who similarly failed to disclose being a victim of sexual assault.",
