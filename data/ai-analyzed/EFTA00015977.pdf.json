    "The defense submitted expert opinions (William Julie for France, David Perry for the UK) stating it is highly unlikely those countries would refuse to extradite Maxwell, especially given her offer to waive extradition rights.",
    "The document reveals Maxwell has a spouse (name redacted) who has a committed relationship with her and is co-signing the bond, contradicting prior statements about a potential divorce.",
    "The defense cites a surge in COVID-19 cases at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) and potential suspension of legal calls/visits as further justification for bail to ensure her right to counsel."
