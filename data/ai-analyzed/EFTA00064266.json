    "The SIS Lieutenant's investigation into Epstein's first suicide attempt in July 2019 was inconclusive. Epstein denied trying to harm himself and said his cellmate, Nicholas Tartaglione, did not harm him.",

    "On August 9, the day before his death, Epstein was provided an unsecured, unmonitored phone call by his unit manager, a serious security violation. The number he called was supposedly for his mother (who was deceased), and a male answered when the manager called to verify it.",
    "Key staff, including the captain and an associate warden, were verbally notified on August 8 that the cameras were down and a memo was written, but the system was not repaired before Epstein's death.",
    "The witness believes the primary responsibility for failing to ensure Epstein had a cellmate on August 9 lies with Officer John Mccoy, who escorted the cellmate out, and the SHU officers who should have notified supervisors, as well as the operations lieutenants who had access to the court list showing the cellmate was leaving (WAB)."
