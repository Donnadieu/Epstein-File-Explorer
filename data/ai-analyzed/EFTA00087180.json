    "BOP records reveal mistakes, sloppiness, and incompetence in dealing with Epstein, including failure to log social calls, delays in psych evaluations, inaccuracies in intake forms, and not providing a cellmate the night he died.",
    "BOP officials concluded they did not appreciate suicide risk factors in Epstein's case quickly enough, such as after his admission and after he was denied bail.",
    "Epstein was subjected to a disciplinary process following his attempted suicide, and the related incident report was later expunged without explanation.",
    "The BOP utilizes 'inmate companions' to monitor inmates on suicide watch, but they do not have direct contact and observe through a cell window.",
    "The closure of the MCC New York was influenced by the need to address systemic issues, some of which were highlighted by the failures in the Epstein case."
