Pagliuca to the U.S. Attorney's Office, outlining Ghislaine Maxwell's good faith objections to certain categories of alleged co-conspirator hearsay statements the government intends to use at trial.

    "The defense for Ghislaine Maxwell is formally objecting to several categories of alleged co-conspirator hearsay statements the government plans to use at trial.",
    "A key objection is that some statements, like Epstein allegedly telling CC-1 that Maxwell 'used to find girls for him,' may post-date the alleged conspiracy and constitute 'idle chatter' not made in furtherance of it.",
    "The defense seeks to limit the scope of 'minor victims' to only those specifically identified by the government in its October 11, 2021, correspondence, excluding other alleged victims from prior Florida investigations.",
    "The defense objects to hearsay statements lacking temporal limitations, arguing they should be confined to the dates of the alleged conspiracy.",
    "The document references direction from Epstein and CC-2 to CC-1 to 'help someone who was coming to take the computers,' which the defense argues does not appear to be during or in furtherance of the charged conspiracy."
