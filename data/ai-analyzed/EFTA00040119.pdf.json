    "Defense counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell is formally objecting to the admission of several categories of alleged co-conspirator hearsay statements proffered by the government.",
    "A key objection is that a statement from Epstein to an employee (CC-1) claiming Maxwell 'used to find girls for him' is 'idle chatter' that post-dates the alleged conspiracy and was not made in furtherance of it.",
    "The defense argues the government must limit its proffered statements to minor victims specifically identified in the indictment or its October 11, 2021, correspondence, and not include statements to other alleged victims from prior Florida investigations.",
    "The defense objects to statements lacking temporal limitations, arguing they should be excluded if made outside the dates of the alleged conspiracy."
