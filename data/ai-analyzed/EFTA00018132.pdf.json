    "The document is a formal request (Hammad Memo) for approval to interview three inmate witnesses regarding Jeffrey Epstein's death.",
    "The investigation focuses on three specific failures by MCC staff: not assigning a cellmate to Epstein as ordered, failing to perform required overnight checks, and falsifying related records.",
    "The three inmates to be interviewed were housed in the same area of the SHU as Epstein on the night of his death and are considered the most likely to have relevant information.",
    "Each of the three inmates is currently being prosecuted by the SDNY for other crimes, but the investigating agents have had no involvement in those cases.",
    "The memo argues the proposed contact is permissible as the inmates are not represented concerning their status as witnesses to Epstein's death, and questioning will be narrowly focused on that event."
