    "The defense is seeking to review over 5,500 'highly confidential' electronic images and videos seized from Jeffrey Epstein's devices, categorized as: ~2,100 never-before-produced images from Epstein's devices, ~3,400 previously reviewed images from discs seized in 2019, and ~7 hard-copy nude images from the FBI Florida investigation.",
    "A significant point of contention is the FBI's restriction that only a single, clean government laptop can be used to review the 'highly confidential' obscene material, which the defense argues impedes Maxwell's ability to meaningfully participate in her defense.",
    "The physical evidence is primarily stored at an FBI warehouse in the Bronx, with conditions that prohibit defense attorneys from bringing laptops or internet-connected devices into the warehouse, allowing only a disconnected digital camera for photography.",
    "The correspondence reveals the massive scale of evidence in the case, including 'bulky' items like massage tables, and indicates the FBI took several weeks to review all the images on the discs seized from Epstein's residences.",
    "The defense alleges that the FBI did not prepare an inventory of evidence when it was seized from New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands, complicating the review process."
