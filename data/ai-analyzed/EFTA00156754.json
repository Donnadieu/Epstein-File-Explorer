  "summary": "This is an academic journal article titled 'The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse: Conceptual and Measurement Issues' published in the Journal of Child Sexual Abuse in 2014. The article critically reviews various definitions and conceptualizations of 'grooming' in child sexual abuse, discusses legal attempts to criminalize it, and highlights the lack of consensus and measurement tools. It does not directly discuss the Epstein case but is a theoretical analysis of the grooming concept. This document is an academic research article analyzing the concept of 'grooming' in child sexual abuse. It reviews literature on grooming strategies used by offenders, proposes a formal definition, and discusses assessment methods. The text is theoretical and does not reference specific Epstein case events or individuals. This document is an academic journal article titled 'Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse' from the Journal of Child Sexual Abuse. It presents a proposed two-part definition of grooming and discusses the need for reliable assessment methods, referencing the Daubert standard for admissibility in court. It contains no specific case details or names related to the Epstein investigation.",

    "It provides a comprehensive literature review on grooming tactics used by child sexual abusers, including bribery, boundary violations, isolation, and sexual desensitization.",
    "The authors propose a formal definition of grooming: 'antecedent inappropriate behavior that functions to increase the likelihood of future sexual abuse.'",
