    "Jeffrey Epstein was found dead by suicide in his cell during this period of no monitoring. The last time anyone approached his tier before his body was discovered was at approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9.",
    "Noel and Thomas falsified count slips for five institutional counts (4 p.m., 10 p.m., 12 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m.) and Noel falsified over 75 entries for 30-minute rounds, leading the MCC to believe inmates were being monitored.",
    "Video surveillance confirmed the officers did not perform the required checks; instead, they sat at their desk, browsed the internet (for furniture sales, motorcycles, sports news), and appeared to sleep for about two hours.",
    "Epstein had been placed in the SHU due to suicidality risk and, after a prior apparent suicide attempt on July 23, 2019, was supposed to have a cellmate, but was alone on the night of his death because his cellmate was transferred out and not replaced.",
    "Two Bureau of Prisons correctional officers, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were federally indicted for falsifying records related to inmate counts in the SHU.",
    "The alleged false records were created and submitted on or about August 10, 2019, the same month Jeffrey Epstein died in custody at the MCC.",
    "The charges include conspiracy to defraud the United States and making false records (violations of Title 18, U.S. Code, Sections 371, 1001(a)(3), and 2).",
    "The indictment specifically accuses them of falsifying slips for the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. institutional counts, indicating a failure to perform required security checks.",
    "The document is a formal indictment, indicating the initiation of a criminal prosecution by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York."
