    "Mark Epstein claims Attorney General Barr's statement that video showed no one entered or left the tier convinced him it was a suicide, but Mark argues this logic is flawed because a killer could have already been on the tier.",
    "Mark Epstein reveals he had agreed to guarantee Jeffrey Epstein's bail (close to $100 million) just days before Jeffrey's death, and a bail hearing was scheduled two days after he died, which Mark says makes a pre-hearing suicide illogical.",
    "Mark Epstein speculates about motives, suggesting Jeffrey Epstein had knowledge from the 2016 election that \"would have to cancel the election,\" and implies this could be a reason he was killed. He also personally suspects Donald Trump could be behind it."
