  "summary": "This is a transcript of a voluntary, sworn interview conducted by the DOJ Office of the Inspector General (OIG) with a former Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) employee, a Maintenance Mechanic Supervisor (General Foreman) at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) New York. The interview is part of an OIG investigation into the events surrounding the death of inmate Jeffrey Epstein. The witness provides background on his employment history and discusses the departure of his supervisor, the Facility Manager. This document is a transcript of an interview with a former Bureau of Prisons employee (referred to as MR. [REDACTED]) regarding his role and responsibilities at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York. The interview focuses on clarifying whether he was the acting facilities manager, his oversight of a camera system upgrade project, and the state of camera infrastructure at the MCC prior to Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration. This document appears to be a transcript of a deposition or interview regarding a contract for camera system upgrades at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) New York. The discussion focuses on a contract with SigNet Technologies, awarded in September 2018, for over 200 cameras and related equipment. The witness, a former facilities manager, states that no cameras or equipment were delivered or installed before his departure in February 2019, contradicting claims from SigNet and other staff. This is a transcript of an interview conducted by Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General agents regarding a camera system installation project at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) New York. The interviewee, a former acting facility manager, provides details about the project's management, storage locations, and institutional procedures, revealing that key equipment was not on-site as previously believed.",

    "The interview is part of the official DOJ OIG investigation (Case #2019-010614) into the events surrounding the death of inmate Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "The witness, a former BOP Maintenance Mechanic Supervisor, was stationed at MCC New York from December 2016 until his last day on February 14, 2019.",
    "The witness's direct supervisor, Facility Manager , left MCC under unusual circumstances after a training conference in Denver and never returned, with communication ceasing entirely.",
    "After the Facility Manager's departure, the witness informally absorbed some of his duties to keep the department operational, with approvals from rotating Associate Wardens of Operations.",
    "The witness signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement restricting discussion of OIG interview documents until the final report is publicly released.",
    "The interviewee's role as 'acting facility manager' was informal and contested; he performed the duties but was not officially promoted or paid for the role, and his decisions were sometimes overridden by executive staff.",
    "A major camera system upgrade project was underway at the MCC from at least 2018 into 2019, aimed at fixing broken cameras, converting from analog to digital, adding cameras to blind spots, and updating infrastructure.",
    "The interviewee confirmed there were long-standing camera issues at the MCC, including broken cameras and an inability to review past footage, which hampered internal investigations well before Jeffrey Epstein's arrival.",
    "By the time the interviewee left in February 2019, no new cameras or wiring from the upgrade project had been installed in the institution, though preparatory work like hanging conduit had begun.",
    "The document reveals internal BOP administrative issues, including confusion over roles, budget constraints affecting procurement, and delays in hiring due to unresolved personnel matters.",
    "A contract worth $698,108 was awarded to SigNet Technologies on 09/21/2018 to replace and add over 200 cameras at MCC New York.",
    "The former facilities manager testified that no cameras, recorders, or related equipment were delivered or on-site before his departure on 02/14/2019, contradicting claims from SigNet.",
    "Internal BOP emails from April 2019 indicate the project was stalled because required fiber cable had not been delivered.",
    "The witness believed SigNet was supposed to bring all equipment for installation, not have it shipped separately to the institution, due to liability concerns.",
    "There are conflicting accounts about equipment delivery, with SigNet claiming delivery around October 2018 and installation in August 2019, while the witness insists he was never notified and no one signed for any delivery.",
    "The interviewee, a former acting facility manager, stated that camera system equipment for an MCC project was not stored on-site at the institution but was likely at an off-site storage building (Building 4) in the Brooklyn Navy Shipyard.",
    "The interview reveals unusual security practices at MCC New York, where communication technicians had live camera monitoring equipment and related hardware in their office—a setup the interviewee found astonishing and contrary to procedures at other institutions.",
    "The project involved multiple layers of management and oversight issues, described as 'too many hands in the pot,' including two wardens, two assistant wardens, two comm techs, and two facility managers.",
    "Building 4 served as a central storage warehouse for multiple MCC departments, containing cages for overstock and operated primarily by food service staff with limited supervision."
