  "summary": "This is a transcript of grand jury testimony from April 24, 2007, in the Southern District of Florida as part of 'Operation Leap Year.' A female witness, age 21, testifies about being recruited at age 16 to give massages to Jeffrey Epstein, the nature of the massages involving nudity and touching, and her subsequent role in recruiting other underage girls for Epstein, detailing the recruitment process, payments, and specific individuals involved. This document is a transcript of grand jury testimony from a witness (likely a victim/recruiter) describing the process of bringing girls to Jeffrey Epstein's residence for massages that turned sexual. The witness details interactions with Epstein and his assistant, payment structures, and Epstein's preference for younger girls.",

  "keyFacts": [
    "The witness was recruited at age 16 by high school acquaintances to give massages to Jeffrey Epstein, with the understanding it involved nudity and fondling for $200.",
    "After one massage where Epstein fondled her and she expressed discomfort, Epstein proposed she instead recruit other girls, paying her $200 for each girl brought.",
    "The witness recruited between 7 and 10 girls, most aged 14-18 from her high school, and instructed them to lie about their age if under 18.",
    "Epstein's assistant, Adriana, was the primary scheduler, and Epstein had a rule that girls must be informed about the nudity and touching before arriving.",
    "Payments were made in $100 bills, and payment amounts to the girls performing massages varied ($100-$400) based on how much they allowed Epstein to do.",
    "The witness was asked by Jeffrey Epstein himself to recruit other girls for massages.",
    "Epstein's assistant, Sarah Kellen, handled scheduling, took down girls' names and numbers, but denied knowledge of intercourse, stating Epstein 'just plays with them.'",
    "Age was never verified or discussed, though the witness recalls Epstein once saying 'the younger the better' and commenting a girl was 'too old.'",
    "Payment varied; one girl received $100 for refusing fondling, while another received $300 for more compliant behavior, and a rumor existed of $1000 for intercourse.",
    "Contact for appointments was made directly with the witness by Kellen, and girls who were favored might later be contacted directly, cutting the witness out of the payment."
