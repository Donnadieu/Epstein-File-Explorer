    "The Southern District of New York was actively investigating Jeffrey Epstein in June 2019 for sex trafficking of minors in New York, specifically at his Manhattan mansion.",
    "The investigation was covert and confidential, with the prosecution team already in touch with victims in New York and Florida.",
    "The email explicitly states an expectation to charge the case within the next week.",
    "A major concern was complying with victims' rights obligations, citing a federal court finding that the U.S. Attorney's Office violated those rights during the prior Florida investigation.",
    "The prosecution team was strategizing on how to handle potential victim outreach, considering directing victims to contact them directly rather than the FBI due to sensitivity over past failures."
