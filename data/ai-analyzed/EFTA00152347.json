    "On June 29, 2020, Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted and an arrest warrant was issued for her on charges including conspiracy to entice minors and perjury.",
    "The government sought and obtained sealed warrants to track two cellphones: one subscribed to 'Terramar Project, Inc.' (T-Mobile) and one subscribed to 'G Max' (AT&T), both believed to be used by Maxwell.",
    "Evidence linking Maxwell to the phones includes a contact saved as 'Ghislaine' in Jeffrey Epstein's phone (seized at his arrest) and recent contacts with her sister, attorneys, and associates.",
    "The application argues that premature disclosure of the investigation could lead Maxwell to flee, intimidate witnesses, or destroy evidence, justifying a one-year non-disclosure order to the service providers.",
    "The warrants authorized 45 days of prospective location/pen register tracking and historical data from June 1, 2020, to locate Maxwell for arrest."
