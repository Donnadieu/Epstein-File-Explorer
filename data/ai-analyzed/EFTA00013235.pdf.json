    "Approximately 40,000 files (300GB) of evidence, described as 'Images Seized During Search' in the FBI case file, were being processed for the US v. Epstein case in September-October 2020.",
    "The evidence was being uploaded to the Relativity review platform under the case name 'US v. Epstein' for stamping with confidentiality markings and Bates numbers.",
    "A discrepancy is noted: a hard drive contained about 41,000 files, but only about 22,000 appeared in the initial productions, prompting questions about whether some native files could not be imaged.",
    "The email chain involves multiple redacted or partially redacted US Attorney's Office (SDNY) contractors, indicating a coordinated effort to handle sensitive discovery materials.",
    "Instructions specify that all documents from this production should be marked 'Confidential' starting at Bates number SDNY_GM_00328864."
