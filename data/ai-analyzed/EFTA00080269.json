  "summary": "This is a Bureau of Prisons investigative report concerning an incident on July 23, 2019, where inmate Jeffrey Epstein was found in his cell with a homemade noose around his neck. The report details the incident, subsequent medical assessments, and interviews with Epstein and his cellmate, Nicholas Tartaglione, concluding there was insufficient evidence of assault and no need for a separation order. This document is a Bureau of Prisons Form 583 Report of Incident and accompanying staff memoranda detailing the events of July 23, 2019, at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, where inmate Jeffrey Epstein was found with an orange cloth around his neck. The reports describe the initial response as a suicide attempt, but later statements from Epstein allege his cellmate, Nicholas Tartaglione, attempted to kill him and extort money. This document contains Bureau of Prisons records from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, primarily documenting the events of July 23, 2019, when inmate Jeffrey Epstein was found in his cell with a rope around his neck. It includes staff shift logs, medical encounter reports for Epstein and his cellmate Nicholas Tartaglione, photo sheets documenting the incident, an administrative detention order for Epstein, and an incident report detailing the suicide attempt.",
