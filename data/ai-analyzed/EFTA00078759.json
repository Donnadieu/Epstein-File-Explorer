  "summary": "This is a legal memorandum from the Office of International Affairs (OIA) analyzing the use of anticipatory waivers of extradition in U.S. bail determinations under the Bail Reform Act. It concludes such waivers provide no assurance a defendant will appear for trial, are generally unenforceable in foreign countries, and prosecutors should oppose their use as a basis for release. The memo reviews relevant case law and advises prosecutors to contact OIA to obtain formal statements from foreign governments on waiver unenforceability.",

    "The Office of International Affairs (OIA) asserts that anticipatory waivers of extradition provide no assurance a defendant will return to court and are unaware of any country that would consider such a waiver binding.",
