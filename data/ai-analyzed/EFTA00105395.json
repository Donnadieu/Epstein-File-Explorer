    "The Southern District of New York sought approval in October 2020 for an AUSA to travel to the U.K. to interview a victim/witness in the Ghislaine Maxwell case.",
    "The travel was deemed necessary because the victim/witness would only provide her statement in person, and her testimony was needed to preserve the government's right to use her at trial.",
    "The witness was identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein, linking the Maxwell prosecution directly to Epstein's crimes.",
    "Audrey Strauss, as Acting U.S. Attorney, was the approving authority for the travel request."
