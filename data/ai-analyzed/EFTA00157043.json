    "Dr. Rocchio, an expert on interpersonal violence, prepared to testify on memory principles and the academic concept of 'grooming' in child sexual abuse.",
    "The document highlights that grooming is not a single act but a series of behaviors, is difficult to recognize in real-time, and lacks a single universally agreed-upon definition despite common tactical patterns.",
    "The Sandusky case is cited as the pivotal moment when the concept of grooming entered widespread public awareness.",
    "Dr. Rocchio's forensic practice involves applying grooming concepts to understand event descriptions and assess the connection between past abuse and later consequences, not to 'evaluate for grooming' directly.",
    "The notes reference multiple academic studies and authors (Winters, Bennett & O'Donohue, Dietz, etc.) to frame the discussion on grooming, indicating the legal proceeding is engaging with scholarly literature on the topic."
