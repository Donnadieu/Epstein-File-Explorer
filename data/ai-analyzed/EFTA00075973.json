    "The court ruled that attorney David Markus, who has represented Ghislaine Maxwell on bail appeals and spoken publicly as her attorney, is subject to Local Criminal Rule 23.1, which restricts extrajudicial statements by lawyers associated with pending criminal litigation.",
    "Markus argued he was not subject to the rule because he had not made a formal appearance in the district court, but the court found the rule applies to lawyers 'associated' with the case, not just those of record.",
    "The order cites Markus's role in handling bail appeals, attending a court proceeding, speaking to the press on Maxwell's behalf, and authoring an op-ed describing himself as 'Maxwell's appellate counsel' as evidence of his association with the case.",
    "The court emphasized that all lawyers, agents, and counsel for potential witnesses associated with the case must avoid extrajudicial statements that could prejudice the trial or risk attorney discipline.",
    "The government did not seek discipline for Markus's prior op-ed, given potential lack of clarity, but the order puts all associated parties on clear notice for future conduct."
