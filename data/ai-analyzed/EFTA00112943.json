  "summary": "This is a transcript of a voluntary interview conducted by the DOJ Office of the Inspector General with a former Federal Bureau of Prisons employee, identified as Mr. [REDACTED], on March 21, 2022. The interview is part of an OIG investigation into the events surrounding the death of inmate Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) New York. The witness provides background on his employment history with the BOP and his role as a General Foreman/Maintenance Mechanic Supervisor at MCC New York from December 2016 to February 2019. This document is a transcript of an interview or deposition with a former Bureau of Prisons employee (referred to as MR. [REDACTED]) regarding his role and responsibilities at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC). The questioning focuses on clarifying whether he was officially the 'acting facility manager' after his supervisor left, and details about a camera system upgrade project at the MCC that was initiated prior to Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration. This document is a deposition transcript discussing a contract for camera system upgrades at MCC New York. The conversation focuses on a contract with SigNet Technologies, delivery of equipment, installation timelines, and confusion about whether cameras and related gear were ever delivered to the facility. The witness, a former facilities manager, states he never saw any new cameras or equipment arrive and questions the delivery claims made by SigNet representatives. This is a transcript of an OIG interview with a former Bureau of Prisons employee regarding the procurement and installation of a camera system at MCC New York, specifically discussing issues with equipment delivery, storage at an offsite building (Building 4), and concerns about comm techs having unauthorized access to live camera feeds.",
