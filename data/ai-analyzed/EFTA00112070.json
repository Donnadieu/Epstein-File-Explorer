    "Prison policy emphasized housing SHU inmates with a cellmate to decrease isolation, provide a distraction, and enable a rescue opportunity, but Epstein was ultimately found dead without a cellmate.",
    "The psychologist was unaware Epstein had signed a new will on August 8, 2019, stating that knowledge of this would have been a red flag leading to him being placed on Psychological Observation."
