  "summary": "This is a deposition transcript from a civil lawsuit (Sheldon Barr and Thomas Gardner v. City of New York and an LLC) where Ghislaine Maxwell is being examined under oath. The questioning focuses on her personal background, her company Ellmax LLC, her residences, and her personal assistant, in relation to an accident that occurred on September 9, 2015. The document is a routine civil discovery deposition, not directly related to the criminal Epstein case, but provides biographical and business details about Maxwell. This is a deposition transcript of Ghislaine Maxwell from April 9, 2019, in a civil case (Index No. 159224/2016). Maxwell is questioned about her LLCs, the purchase and details of her New York City townhouse at 116 East 65th Street, her business activities, and her housekeeper. The deposition reveals her connection to Jeffrey Epstein and his lawyer Darren Indyke. This is a deposition transcript of Ghislaine Maxwell from April 9, 2019, taken as part of a civil lawsuit (NYSCEF Index No. 159224/2016). Maxwell is questioned about the layout and use of her New York City townhouse, her business entities (Ellmax, LLC and Terramar Project, Inc.), and an alleged sidewalk accident that occurred there in September 2015. The questioning focuses on whether the property was used for business or as a personal residence. This document is a transcript of a deposition of Ghislaine Maxwell taken on April 9, 2019, in a civil case (Index No. 159224/2016). The questioning focuses on her residence at 116 East 65th Street in New York, her business entities Ellmax and the Terramar Project, and the sale of the property. She denies receiving salary or hosting events for these entities at her home. This appears to be a deposition transcript from a civil case (Index No. 159224/2016) in New York, likely involving Jeffrey Epstein or related entities. The document is heavily redacted and consists primarily of an index of terms and page/line references, making substantive content extraction difficult. It references numerous locations, entities (LLCs), and terms related to properties, finances, and legal proceedings. This document is an errata sheet filed with the New York County Clerk on March 5, 2020, for a deposition transcript in a case with index number 159224/2016. It is a sworn statement from a witness requesting corrections to their testimony, prepared by Lexitas Court Reporting.",

    "Ghislaine Maxwell owned a townhouse at 116 East 65th Street in NYC, which she purchased in 2000 through an LLC and sold in April 2016 for about $15.05 million.",
    "Maxwell testified she used the property solely as a single-family personal residence, not for business, despite having a home office and running entities like Ellmax LLC and Terramar Project.",
    "An alleged sidewalk accident occurred in front of the property on September 9, 2015; Maxwell stated she was informed by staff but did not witness it or provide aid.",
    "Maxwell was president of the Terramar Project, a non-profit formed around 2011-2012, which had directors like Larry Kevin and Ariadne Calvo-Platero and a contractor, Robert Foos.",
    "The deposition is part of a civil lawsuit (NYSCEF Index No. 159224/2016), likely related to the sidewalk accident, focusing on the property's use and condition.",
    "Ghislaine Maxwell lived at 116 East 65th Street in New York City from 2000 until she sold the property in April 2016.",
    "Maxwell was president of the Terramar Project (a not-for-profit) and ran a business named Ellmax, but she testified she never collected a salary or profits from either entity and used her home address only for mail.",
    "Maxwell testified that Ellmax generated only a \"small amount\" of revenue between 2010-2013, which was used to defer travel costs, and that the business ceased operations in 2013 because it \"wasn't going to succeed.\"",
    "Maxwell stated the Terramar Project never hosted any events, fundraisers, or invited the public to her home, and there was no space set aside solely for its use.",
    "Maxwell did not attend the closing for the sale of her home; she authorized her lawyer, Monte Albers De Leon, to execute documents on her behalf.",
    "The document is a deposition transcript index from New York County case 159224/2016, filed in 2016.",
    "Ghislaine 'Maxwell' is the most frequently referenced term (79 mentions), indicating she is a central subject of the deposition.",
    "The index references numerous properties and financial terms like 'home', 'house', 'purchase', 'tax', 'income', and multiple LLCs, suggesting the deposition covered Epstein/Maxwell's assets and financial dealings.",
    "The address '65th Street' is referenced 72 times, indicating it is a property of significant focus, likely one of Epstein's residences.",
    "The document is heavily procedural, consisting of a term index with page/line numbers, making extraction of specific narrative events or detailed relationships impossible from this chunk.",
    "This is a legal filing (errata sheet) related to case index number 159224/2016 in New York County.",
    "A witness is submitting sworn corrections to their deposition testimony.",
    "The document was filed on March 5, 2020, and prepared by Lexitas Court Reporting."
