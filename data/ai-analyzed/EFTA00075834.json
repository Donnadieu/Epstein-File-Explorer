    "FBI case 90A-NY-3151227 is explicitly related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "Technical efforts in August 2019 focused on recovering video evidence from DVR systems, specifically DVR 1 and DVR 2.",
    "DVR 2's disk array configuration was lost, likely because disks were pulled out live; 3 disks required repair.",
    "Access to the DVR Main Controller was blocked without an Administrator password, which the FBI was attempting to obtain.",
    "The correspondence indicates an active forensic process to reconstruct and access potential video evidence shortly after Epstein's arrest and death."
