  "summary": "This is a 2022 opinion and order by Judge Alison J. Nathan addressing Ghislaine Maxwell's post-trial motions following her conviction. The court denies most motions but grants her claim that three conspiracy counts are multiplicitous, concluding they constitute a single conspiracy with Jeffrey Epstein. The court will enter judgment on only one of the three conspiracy counts. This is a court opinion/order (Document 657) filed in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell (Case 1:20-cr-00330). The court denies Maxwell's Rule 29 motion for acquittal on several counts but finds Counts One and Five multiplicitous with other counts, vacating judgment on those. It also denies a motion claiming constructive amendment or prejudicial variance. The document analyzes the evidence presented at trial, particularly regarding the conspiracy and sex trafficking charges. This is a court opinion/order (Document 657) from the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal case, filed on April 29, 2022. It addresses the defendant's motion for a new trial, specifically rejecting her claim that a constructive amendment of the indictment occurred during her trial. The court analyzes jury instructions, evidence presented, and a jury note related to Counts Three and Four (Mann Act violations). This is a court opinion/order (Document 657) filed on April 29, 2022, in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell (Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN). The document denies Maxwell's post-trial motions, including a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal and motions based on claims of constructive amendment/variance and pre-indictment delay. The court addresses jury instructions, evidence related to abuse in New Mexico, and the sufficiency of evidence supporting the convictions. This is a court order from Judge Alison J. Nathan resolving a motion in the Ghislaine Maxwell case. The order denies motions regarding variance and pre-indictment delay, grants a motion regarding multiplicity of counts, and confirms the conviction on Counts Three, Four, and Six. It also notes the sentencing date for Ghislaine Maxwell remains scheduled for June 28, 2022.",

    "The conspiracy employed a single 'playbook' to groom and sexually abuse underage girls from 1994 to 2004, constituting one continuous conspiracy with multiple victims.",
    "The court denied Maxwell's motions for acquittal based on insufficient evidence, constructive amendment/variance of the indictment, and prosecutorial delay.",
    "Judgment will be entered on Count Three alone among the conspiracy counts, but the jury's factual findings of guilt on all counts remain valid.",
    "The court found Counts One and Five multiplicitous with other counts, meaning the jury effectively found the same criminal conduct multiple times; judgment was entered only on Count Three.",
    "The government's theory at trial presented a single decade-long conspiracy between Maxwell and Epstein to sexually abuse underage girls, using a common 'playbook' of grooming.",
    "Substantial evidence supported Maxwell's convictions, including victim testimony about travel arrangements, scheduling of sexualized massages, direct payments, and physical touching.",
    "The court denied Maxwell's Rule 29 motion for acquittal on Counts Three (conspiracy to transport minors), Four (transportation of Jane), and Six (sex trafficking of Carolyn).",
    "The document references a 'pyramid scheme of abuse' starting around 2001, where Maxwell directly called minors to schedule appointments for Epstein.",
    "The court denied Ghislaine Maxwell's motion for a new trial, rejecting her claim that a constructive amendment of the indictment occurred.",
    "The core of criminality for Counts Three and Four was a scheme by Epstein and Maxwell to cause underage girls to travel to New York with intent to engage in sexual activity violating New York law.",
    "A key issue was a jury note asking about guilt under Count Four if Maxwell aided only a return flight from New Mexico, not the flight to New Mexico where intent for sexual activity was formed.",
    "The court found the jury note ambiguous and responded by referring the jury back to the original charge, which correctly stated New York law as the predicate.",
    "Testimony about sexual activity in states other than New York (like New Mexico and Florida) was admitted as relevant evidence of intent for the New York-based scheme, not as independent bases for conviction.",
    "The court denied Ghislaine Maxwell's motion for judgment of acquittal (Rule 29), finding the guilty verdicts were supported by witness testimony and documentary evidence.",
    "The court rejected Maxwell's claim of constructive amendment/variance regarding jury instructions, concluding the jury was properly instructed that only a violation of New York law (Penal Law Section 130.55) could be the predicate for the Mann Act counts.",
    "The court addressed testimony about sexual abuse in New Mexico, finding the defense had adequate notice (received Nov. 6, 2021) and was not unfairly surprised or prejudiced.",
    "The court denied Maxwell's pre-indictment delay claim, finding she failed to prove the government intentionally delayed for tactical advantage or that she suffered actual and substantial prejudice from lost evidence or deceased witnesses.",
    "The defense argued prejudice from missing documents (flight, financial, phone, property records) and deceased witnesses (architects, property manager, housekeeper), but the court found these claims speculative and insufficient.",
