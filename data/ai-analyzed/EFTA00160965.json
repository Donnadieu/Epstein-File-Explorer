    "A federal judge ruled that prosecutors, including then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, broke federal law by concealing a plea agreement with Jeffrey Epstein from more than 30 of his underage victims.",

    "The evidence reviewed by the judge showed Epstein operated an international sex operation recruiting underage girls from Florida and overseas.",
    "The non-prosecution agreement, negotiated by Acosta, gave Epstein and his co-conspirators immunity from federal prosecution instead of prosecuting him under federal sex trafficking laws.",
    "Legal opinions on the deal were divided, with a former FBI agent calling it a 'sweetheart deal' and a former Trump White House lawyer defending it as appropriate given Epstein's 18-month prison term and sex offender registration."
