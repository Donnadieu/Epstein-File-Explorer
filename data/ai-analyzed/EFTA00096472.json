    "The defense identified significant technical discrepancies in the government's discovery production of photos from CDs recovered from Jeffrey Epstein's residence, including mismatched MD5 hash values between an overlay file and a 'non-nude' index.",
    "Laura Menninger stated there were 65 production numbers that didn't match the index when checking hash values, and 17 files had no hash values at all, indicating corrupt or incomplete files.",
    "The defense reported that thousands of photo files were unreadable both by counsel and by Ghislaine Maxwell on her MDC laptop, impeding their constitutional right to review discovery.",
    "The defense challenged the 'highly confidential' designation of photos containing adult nudity, arguing it imposed an extraordinary cost and impeded their defense, and requested replicas of hard drives for proper review.",
    "The email chain reveals ongoing friction and failed technical resolutions between the prosecution and defense regarding the handling of digital evidence, with the defense threatening to involve the court."
