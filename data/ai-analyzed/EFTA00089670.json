  "summary": "This document is an email chain from November 2020 between Ghislaine Maxwell's defense attorney, Bobbi C. Sternheim, and an Assistant United States Attorney regarding concerns about Maxwell's detention conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC). Sternheim alleges inhumane conditions in Maxwell's isolation cell, including cold, moisture, and a sewage stench, and requests immediate assistance. The AUSA responds that MDC staff investigated and found the conditions to be within normal parameters, but that some accommodations (extra blanket, cup, snack) would be provided.",

    "Ghislaine Maxwell's defense attorney alleged she was being held in an isolation cell with 'cold, moisture, and sewage stench' that was 'unhealthy, unbearable, and utterly unreasonable' at the MDC in November 2020.",
    "Maxwell's requests for an extra blanket, to use a mug for water, and to keep a snack in her cell had reportedly been denied, forcing her to 'cup her hands to drink water from the faucet.'",
    "The MDC, via legal counsel, disputed the allegations, reporting temperature checks showed 71-74°F, no observed moisture or smell, and that staff would provide an extra blanket (bringing her total to three), a cup, and allow a snack.",
    "Defense attorney Bobbi C. Sternheim characterized the treatment as the worst she had witnessed in her 35-year career, including representing terrorism and capital murder defendants in high-security facilities."
