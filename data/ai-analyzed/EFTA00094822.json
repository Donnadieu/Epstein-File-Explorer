    "In early January 2020, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York was coordinating its response to information requests from civil plaintiffs in Jeffrey Epstein-related lawsuits.",
    "The office designated a specific Assistant U.S. Attorney as the point of contact to handle 'Touhy requests' for Epstein-related information from civil plaintiffs' counsel, notably Robbie Kaplan.",
    "The correspondence includes detailed draft legal language explaining the stringent Department of Justice regulations (Touhy regulations) that govern the disclosure of information from criminal investigations for use in unrelated civil litigation.",
    "The emails reveal an internal procedural separation, where criminal AUSAs would handle the investigative work, but a civil AUSA would manage external communications to avoid conflicts with victim-witnesses in ongoing criminal matters."
