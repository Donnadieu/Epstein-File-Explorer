  "keyFacts": [
    "Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide on August 10, 2019, while in pretrial custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York.",
    "The reconstruction report was severely limited because the FBI had confiscated the original video footage and formal interviews were not conducted to avoid interfering with other DOJ investigations.",
    "On July 23, 2019, Epstein was found with a cloth around his neck but denied it was a suicide attempt, instead suggesting his cellmate had tried to kill him; an investigation could not determine what happened.",
    "Key suicide risk factors identified included the stigma of his charges, loss of status, the unsealing of damaging court documents on August 9, 2019, and his reported difficulty adjusting to prison life.",
    "The report notes critical operational failures: Epstein was single-celled the night he died despite policy, and two staff members admitted to not completing required 30-minute rounds in the hours before his death.",
    "The report documents widespread failures in BOP procedures regarding Epstein's incarceration, including inaccurate documentation, lack of proper observation, and failure to follow suicide prevention protocols.",
    "Critical evidence was mishandled: four attorney log books were not secured as evidence following Epstein's death, and suicide watch log books were falsified by a staff member copying and initialing another officer's entries.",
    "Epstein received an unmonitored telephone call on August 9, 2019, facilitated by staff who dialed a number for him (area code 347) after he claimed he was calling his mother, who had been deceased since 2004.",
    "SENTRY, the BOP's inmate management system, contained numerous inaccuracies regarding Epstein's and other inmates' cell assignments, including showing three inmates assigned to a double-occupancy cell.",
    "The report concludes that staff lacked a broad understanding of sex offender risk factors, which was vital for Epstein's adjustment and safety, and recommends supplemental training."
