  "summary": "This is the U.S. Government's Response to Petitioners' Submission on Proposed Remedies in a civil action filed by Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2. The government, represented by U.S. Attorney Byung J. Pak, argues that the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) does not authorize the equitable remedies sought by the victims (rescission, apology, informational, educational). It acknowledges a failure to communicate transparently with victims about the Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) with Jeffrey Epstein and proposes alternative remedies including a meeting with a DOJ representative, a public victim impact hearing, and additional CVRA training for prosecutors. This is a government response (Document 462) in the ongoing CVRA case regarding the 2007 Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) with Jeffrey Epstein. The government argues against the petitioners' request for partial rescission of the NPA, stating it would harm some victims, lacks legal basis in contract law, and would reward the government for its CVRA violation. It also opposes requests for declaratory and injunctive relief. This is a court filing (Document 462) from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia, opposing victims' requests for remedies under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) in the case Doe v. United States. It argues against granting victims access to grand jury materials, government files, or monetary damages, and supports the government's proposed remedies, which include conferring with victims. The filing includes an exhibit of a May 7, 2019, letter from the U.S. Attorney to victims' counsel.",

    "The court previously found the U.S. government violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) by failing to confer with Jeffrey Epstein's victims before entering into a Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) with him.",
    "The government argues the CVRA does not authorize the equitable remedies (rescission, apology, etc.) sought by the victims and provides no cause of action for damages against the United States.",
    "The government acknowledges it should have communicated more transparently with the victims about the resolution of the Epstein case and proposes alternative remedies: a meeting with a DOJ representative, a public victim impact hearing, and additional CVRA training for prosecutors.",
    "The document reveals that more than a dozen victims invoked the NPA to enter into civil settlements with Epstein while protecting their anonymity.",
    "The government's legal position is that CVRA obligations do not attach prior to formal charges being filed, though it admits its policy often goes beyond this legal minimum.",
    "The government argues that partial rescission of the 2007 NPA would harm some victims who value anonymity and have settled with Epstein, and could undermine benefits like his felony conviction and restitution agreements.",
    "The government contends partial rescission has no basis in contract law because the NPA is an indivisible agreement; removing the immunity provisions would eliminate the essence of the contract.",
    "The government states its outreach to victims revealed a split: some want Epstein prosecuted and are willing to testify, while others fear exposure and do not want to participate in any litigation.",
    "The government opposes petitioners' requests for injunctive relief, including a court-ordered apology, 'best efforts' injunction, and mandatory training, citing lack of standing and legal authority.",
    "The document reveals that over a decade has passed since the NPA, and the government argues this delay exacerbates potential harm to victims who have tried to move on with their lives.",
    "The U.S. government argues the CVRA does not grant victims a right to access grand jury materials, sensitive investigative files, or government discovery, citing protections for law enforcement techniques and victim privacy.",
    "The filing states the CVRA explicitly prohibits a cause of action for monetary damages against the United States, barring the victims' requests for sanctions, restitution, or attorneys' fees.",
    "The government acknowledges its past conduct in the Epstein case 'fell short' of its dedication to victims but argues the court cannot order future prosecutorial actions without violating separation of powers.",
    "An attached letter reveals the U.S. Attorney's Office sought to confer personally with victims and was considering all proposed remedies, including rescission of the non-prosecution agreement (NPA).",
    "The document indicates victims likely held diverse opinions on an appropriate remedy, with some possibly opposing rescission of the NPA."
