    "In April 2021, a federal judge (Engelmayer) was highly skeptical of the DOJ's broad use of Exemption 7(A) to withhold documents in a FOIA case related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "The court ordered an in camera review of the withheld documents and required the government to specify which withholdings were related to the 'Tortaglione' case versus the broader 'Noel' criminal case.",
    "The court directed the AUSAs to consult with a supervisor (Audrey) and consider whether to confer with Main Justice, noting the recent change in administration might be relevant to the FOIA response.",
    "The email chain shows internal DOJ coordination and scheduling to discuss the court's adverse ruling and next steps in the FOIA litigation."
