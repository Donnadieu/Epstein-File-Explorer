    "The correspondence reveals ongoing legal negotiations between defense and prosecution teams regarding the public filing of sensitive documents in the Ghislaine Maxwell case.",
    "Primary points of contention involve redactions to protect the names and contact information of victims, third parties, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys (AUSAs).",
    "The defense indicates it made some redactions 'as a courtesy' because it did not think it 'necessary or appropriate to publicly name the AUSAs.'",
    "Multiple reply briefs (1, 3, 5, 6, 10) and their exhibits are discussed, with disagreements on whether certain information designated as 'Confidential' by the government should be publicly filed.",
    "The government's position emphasizes protecting 'the personal privacy interests of victims and third parties' as the basis for keeping certain exhibits sealed or redacted."
