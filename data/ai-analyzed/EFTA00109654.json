  "summary": "This document is a Bureau of Prisons roster and set of transfer receipts for the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) New York, dated August 8, 2019. It includes a long list of inmates with their details and status codes, and specific transfer/release paperwork for several individuals, including Jeffrey Epstein. The document shows Epstein was in custody at MCC New York with a status of 'A-PRE' (likely present) as of that date. This document is a collection of U.S. Marshals and Bureau of Prisons forms from early August 2019, detailing prisoner remands, releases, and transfers at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York. It includes rosters, receipts, and release authorizations for multiple inmates, showing routine prison administration operations during this period.",
