  "summary": "This is a reply letter from Ghislaine Maxwell's defense attorney to Judge Alison J. Nathan, filed under seal, in support of a request to modify a protective order. The letter argues that Maxwell should be allowed to inform the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and a district court judge in a related civil case that her civil adversary has already provided nearly 90,000 pages of sealed civil discovery materials to the U.S. Attorney's Office via subpoena, and that these materials now constitute over half of the criminal discovery against her. The defense contests the government's claims that the civil case is unrelated and that its subpoena practice was standard.",
