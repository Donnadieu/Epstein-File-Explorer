  "keyFacts": [
    "Over 1 million documents were seized from Epstein's properties, but the review was hampered by severe technical and organizational issues.",
    "Evidence included 9 IDE hard drives from a 2007 search found copied in the NY apartment, over 40 devices from NY, over 25 devices from the Virgin Islands (including servers), and at least 60+ CDs.",
    "A major problem was the inability to link emails to their attachments in the received data, making review and future production to defense counsel extremely difficult.",
    "The data load files had control numbers that did not match the native files, and there was no link between them, rendering many large files 'completely invisible' to reviewers.",
    "The correspondence reveals ongoing frustration and a lack of basic inventory ('a very basic list of each device or item that was seized and searched') nearly two months after the evidence was requested."
