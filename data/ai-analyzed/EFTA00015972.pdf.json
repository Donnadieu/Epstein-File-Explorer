    "Judge Engelmayer ordered a BOP declaration to explain why accommodations for discovery and counsel access provided to Ghislaine Maxwell at MDC could not be extended to Justin Rivera at MCC.",
    "The documented disparities are significant: Maxwell had 91 hours/week for electronic discovery review versus Rivera's 21 hours, and 15 hours/week for counsel video visits versus Rivera's 6 hours.",
    "The defense counsel for Rivera suggested the disparity in treatment was due to race, gender, and class, which the judge acknowledged created 'terrible' optics.",
    "The government's initial explanation for the disparity centered on the defendants' different housing situations: Maxwell was held outside general population at MDC, while Rivera was in general population at MCC.",
    "The Maxwell investigation involved the seizure of over 60 devices and the entire FBI file from the prior Florida investigation, contributing to the 'enormous volumes' of discovery material."
