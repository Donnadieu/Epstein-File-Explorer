    "The document is a draft victim notification letter dated December 9, 2020, regarding a felony plea offer in the Epstein case.",
    "The plea offer is intended for an unnamed individual who is not Ghislaine Maxwell, as the letter explicitly states she is 'not charged with any criminal offenses, and this office has not yet extended any plea offer to her.'",
    "The letter outlines a process for victims to confer with prosecutors about the plea offer before it is formally issued, indicating victim consultation was part of the pre-plea process.",
    "The letter deliberately does not reference the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) due to ongoing litigation in the Eleventh Circuit regarding its application to pre-indictment pleas.",
    "Contact information is provided for the case prosecutors and a Victim Witness Coordinator, but the specific names of the prosecutors are redacted in the provided text."
