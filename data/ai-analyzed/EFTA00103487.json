    "The response to the request involved providing the requester with a detailed explanation of the Department of Justice's Touhy regulations, which govern the disclosure of information from government investigations for use in unrelated litigation.",
    "The law enforcement privilege was cited as a potential barrier to disclosure, as it protects confidential sources, investigatory records, and investigative techniques from cases where the government is not a party.",
    "The email chain shows the procedural steps and legal considerations involved in responding to third-party requests for information from a high-profile criminal investigation."
