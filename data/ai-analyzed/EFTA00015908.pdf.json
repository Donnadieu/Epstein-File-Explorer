    "Ghislaine Maxwell's defense attorney requested she be permitted to use a laptop instead of the MDC computer for extended hours (6 AM to 9:30 PM daily, 10:30 PM weekends) to review voluminous discovery.",
    "Maxwell's attorney detailed numerous restrictive conditions: constant rotation of security staff, invasive surveillance while showering, excessive searches (open-mouth, wanding, pat-down), multiple daily cell searches disrupting legal work, and a cold cell with precipitation on walls.",
    "Over the holiday weekend, a third blanket used by Maxwell for warmth was removed, leaving her cold and contributing to the onset of a cold; it was returned after counsel complained.",
    "Maxwell had not received daily newspapers for almost three weeks and had not received certified and non-certified mail for over a week, despite return receipts indicating delivery to MDC on December 17, 2020.",
    "The MDC computer was described as inadequate, turning off every two hours, incapable of opening all documents, and potentially overtaxed by the volume of discovery."
