    "The emails detail the transfer of digital evidence from multiple devices (identified by NYC evidence numbers like NYCO24332) for the Ghislaine Maxwell case to be uploaded to the Relativity platform.",
    "There is a specific mention of approximately 71,000 zero-byte (empty) files found in the initial seven devices provided, which is noted as a common occurrence in data recovery software.",
    "Several devices (e.g., NYC024376 through 380, drives in NYC024395) are noted as still being processed, with some requiring hardware recovery due to physical drive failures, indicating a complex data extraction process.",
    "The correspondence highlights meticulous tracking and verification of evidence items, with spreadsheets used to confirm which devices have been provided and which are outstanding."
