    "The Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (EVCP) is a voluntary, independent program established to compensate victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein, administered by Kenneth R. Feinberg and Camille S. Biros.",
    "The program has no cap on aggregate or individual compensation amounts, and the Administrator has final, binding authority over eligibility and valuation decisions.",
    "Eligibility extends to victims regardless of when or where the abuse occurred, the statute of limitations, or whether they previously settled with Epstein.",
    "The protocol explicitly states that individuals who allegedly assisted Epstein in procuring other victims may be eligible if they acted under duress due to their own abuse by Epstein.",
    "Claimants who accept compensation must sign a release but are not bound by confidentiality rules and are free to discuss their allegations with law enforcement or anyone else."
