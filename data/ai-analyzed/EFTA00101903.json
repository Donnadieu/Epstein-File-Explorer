  "summary": "This is a letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York to Judge Alison J. Nathan regarding the proposed protective order in the case against Ghislaine Maxwell. The government opposes two specific modifications requested by the defense: (1) allowing the defense to publicly name victims who have spoken publicly about Epstein or Maxwell in any forum, and (2) imposing restrictions on the government's use of its own investigative materials. The government argues for protecting victim privacy under the Crime Victims' Rights Act. This is a proposed protective order filed in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell (20 Cr. 330). The order, issued by Judge Alison J. Nathan, establishes strict rules for handling discovery materials produced by the government, including confidential and highly confidential information (the latter containing sexualized images/videos), to protect victim/witness privacy and the ongoing investigation.",

  "keyFacts": [
    "The government strongly opposes the defense's request to be allowed to publicly name any victim who has ever spoken about Epstein or Maxwell in any public forum (media, social media, litigation), arguing it is overly broad and violates victim privacy rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act.",
    "The government's proposed protective order would allow the defense to reference victim names in sealed filings and private investigative conversations, and to publicly name only those victims who choose to identify themselves on the record in *this specific* Maxwell case.",
    "The government also opposes the defense's unprecedented request to restrict how the government uses its own investigative documents with witnesses, calling it nonsensical and without legal basis.",
    "The document reveals strategic tension: the government aims to protect victim privacy and prevent witness intimidation, while it characterizes the defense's motives as potentially aimed at discouraging witness cooperation.",
    "The filing cites legal precedents (United States v. Corley, Kelly, Paris) and the Crime Victims' Rights Act to support protecting victim identities from public disclosure by the defense.",
    "The protective order is designed to safeguard discovery materials that contain sensitive personal information, could impede an ongoing investigation, or risk prejudicial pretrial publicity.",
    "Discovery includes 'Highly Confidential Information' defined as containing 'nude, partially-nude, or otherwise sexualized images, videos, or other depictions of individuals.'",
    "The order imposes strict controls on how the defendant and her counsel can access, copy, and share discovery, including limiting the defendant's review of confidential materials to the presence of her attorneys.",
    "The identity of victims and witnesses referenced in discovery is protected from public disclosure unless they have already identified themselves publicly on the record.",
    "The document reveals the government's ongoing investigation at the time (July 2020) and concerns about protecting victims and witnesses in the high-profile case."
