Everdell to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, renewing a request for the FBI case file concerning the investigation of an individual (name redacted). The letter argues the file is now relevant due to the superseding indictment broadening allegations against Ghislaine Maxwell up to 2004, and that it contains evidence related to a new accuser (Minor Victim-4) and a 2016 meeting central to Maxwell's motion to suppress.",
