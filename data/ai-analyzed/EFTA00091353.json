    "The document reveals the plaintiff sought information on joint defense agreements between Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, and between Maxwell and Alan Dershowitz, with Maxwell indicating she is withholding such documents on privilege grounds.",
    "Maxwell states she has a 'practice of deleting emails after they have been read,' which is cited as an objection to the burden of recalling document dispositions.",
