  "summary": "This is a legal filing by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense counsel objecting to the unsealing of specific docket entries (DE 143, 172, 199) in her civil case, while not objecting to the future unsealing of DEs 164 and 230. The accompanying memorandum argues the sealed materials relate to old discovery disputes and contain sensitive information about non-parties, warranting continued sealing. This document is a legal filing, likely a motion or memorandum, arguing for the continued sealing of various court records (designated as DE exhibits) in a defamation case involving Ghislaine Maxwell. It cites countervailing interests such as reliance on protective orders, prevention of abuse of court records, and protection of ongoing investigations to justify sealing deposition transcripts, flight logs, police reports, and other materials containing names of non-parties. This is a legal memorandum filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's legal team objecting to the unsealing of various court documents (DE filings) in the civil case. It argues that sealed materials containing deposition testimony of non-party individuals (including Jane Does) should remain sealed due to protective orders, privacy concerns, and the rights of those under investigation. The document references numerous docket entries containing testimony and references to non-parties.",

    "Ghislaine Maxwell's legal team objected to unsealing docket entries DE 143, 172, and 199, arguing they relate to five-year-old discovery disputes and contain sensitive non-party information.",
    "The objection states DE 143 concerns the plaintiff's attempt to compel Maxwell to answer 'intrusive questions about her sex life' and quotes from her first seven-hour deposition.",
    "Maxwell's team did not object to the future unsealing of DEs 164 and 230 but argued it was premature as multiple non-party 'Does' are referenced and need notice.",
    "The filing references a Palm Beach Police Report as Exhibit 3 within the sealed materials (DE 144-1-7).",
    "The document is part of a court-ordered protocol (from March 31, 2020) to review sealed materials for potential public access.",
    "The filing argues extensively for sealing court records, citing Ghislaine Maxwell's reasonable reliance on a protective order for her deposition testimony.",
    "It references the submission of sensitive materials including flight logs, Palm Beach police reports, and hearsay transcripts from a deceased, unreliable individual.",
    "The document states that investigations related to Jeffrey Epstein's alleged conduct are ongoing, creating a countervailing interest for sealing to protect witnesses and the integrity of investigations.",
    "It classifies many submitted exhibits (like attorney emails and certain depositions) as 'non-judicial documents' that should not be subject to public access as they were not used in adjudication.",
    "The document is a legal filing from Ghislaine Maxwell's attorneys (Pagliuca, Menninger, Gee) objecting to unsealing court records, dated June 10, 2020.",
    "It argues for keeping sealed numerous docket entries (DEs) containing deposition testimony of non-party 'Jane Does' and others, citing protective orders, privacy, embarrassment, and rights of criminal suspects.",
    "Specific references are made to testimony of 'J. Doe 1' who expressed a desire for no further involvement and had difficulty recalling details due to a medical condition.",
    "The filing indicates a large number of non-parties are referenced across the sealed documents (e.g., DE 229-1 references 33 non-parties).",
    "The legal arguments for sealing are based on countervailing interests CI-1 through CI-4, including reasonable reliance on protective orders and preventing abuse of court records."
