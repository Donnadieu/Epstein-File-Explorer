    "The article identifies the Jeffrey Epstein case as a prime example of questionable prosecutorial discretion, where a 'seemingly light' prosecution deal was reached despite serious allegations.",
    "It notes that the U.S. attorney in the Epstein case violated the Crime Victims Reporting Act by failing to notify victims of the non-prosecution agreement, as found by a federal judge in 2019.",
    "The legal analysis centers on the enormous independence of prosecutors in charging decisions, citing legal precedent that courts generally will not interfere with this discretion.",
    "The commentary raises the ethical question of whether prosecutors can or should exercise discretion to decline prosecution for high-profile figures even when evidence of guilt exists, referencing the Mueller investigation as a parallel."
