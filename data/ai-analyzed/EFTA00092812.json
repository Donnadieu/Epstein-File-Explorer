    "Jail officials had promised to monitor Epstein every 30 minutes and keep him with a cellmate, but these protocols were not followed.",
    "The Bureau of Prisons was described as suffering from chronic understaffing, with a loss of about 4,000 positions since 2017, leading to practices like 'augmentation' where non-officers fill guard roles.",
    "Epstein had been placed on suicide watch on July 23 after a prior incident but was removed days later at the request of his attorneys and after psychological evaluations."
