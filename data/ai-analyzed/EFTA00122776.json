    "The document is a Bureau of Prisons (BOP) procedural checklist titled 'National Suicide Prevention Program Suicide Reconstruction Materials' dated June 30, 2013.",
    "It outlines a comprehensive list of requirements for investigating an inmate suicide, including securing the scene, collecting digital reports (TRU-INTEL, TRU VIEW), staff memorandums, photographs, video footage, and extensive inmate records.",
    "The procedure mandates the identification of a single coordinator (typically the SIA - Suicide Investigation Administrator) to manage documentation collection and serve as the team contact.",
    "Required materials include inmate files (medical, psychological, disciplinary), police reports, FBI referrals, autopsy reports, and any note left by the deceased.",
    "The final compiled binder becomes a permanent record that leaves with the reconstruction team, indicating a formalized, evidence-preserving investigative process."
