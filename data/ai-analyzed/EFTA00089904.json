Nathan in the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal case, ruling on the government's motion to preclude the expert testimony of Dr. Ryan Hall. The court precludes Dr. Hall from testifying as an expert about psychological diagnoses of 'Alleged Victim 4' due to lack of probative value and risk of unfair prejudice, but reserves judgment on his potential fact testimony regarding prior inconsistent statements.",

    "The court precluded defense expert Dr. Ryan Hall from testifying about psychological diagnoses of 'Alleged Victim 4', finding the diagnoses (over 12 years old) had little probative value and risked unfair prejudice under Rules 401 and 403.",
    "Dr. Hall's report indicated 'Alleged Victim 4' did not identify Ghislaine Maxwell as a perpetrator of abuse during his evaluation, a point the defense may seek to introduce as a prior inconsistent statement.",
    "The court will permit cross-examination of 'Alleged Victim 4' about substance use during and after the alleged events, but not Dr. Hall's expert diagnosis of substance abuse disorders.",
    "The ruling is a pretrial decision; the defense may re-raise the request to admit Dr. Hall's expert testimony if facts at trial alter the court's analysis.",
    "The document references other defense experts (Drs. Dietz and Loftus) and a government expert (Dr. Rocchio), showing the battle over expert testimony in the case."
