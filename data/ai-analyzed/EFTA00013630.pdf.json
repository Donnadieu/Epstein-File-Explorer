  "summary": "This is a November 16, 2007 editorial from The Palm Beach Post criticizing the potential plea deal for Jeffrey Epstein. It argues that a plea to a single felony count of solicitation of prostitution, which does not acknowledge the underage status of the victims, would be an injustice. The editorial highlights the involvement of high-profile attorneys and questions whether wealth is influencing the criminal justice process.",
