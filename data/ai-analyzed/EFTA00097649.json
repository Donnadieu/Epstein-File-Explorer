  "summary": "This is a reply memorandum filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense attorneys in support of a motion to suppress evidence obtained from a grand jury subpoena issued to the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP. The motion argues the government violated Maxwell's Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and due process rights by obtaining 90,000 pages of confidential material without proper notice and through misleading the court. It seeks suppression of all such evidence and dismissal of Counts Five and Six (perjury counts) of her indictment.",
