  "keyFacts": [
    "The court found attorney David Markus to be sufficiently 'associated' with the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal case to be bound by Local Criminal Rule 23.1, which restricts extrajudicial statements that could prejudice a fair trial.",
    "Markus's association was established through his representation of Maxwell on bail appeals, his attendance at a court proceeding, his statements to the press on her behalf, and his self-identification as her 'appellate counsel' in a published op-ed.",
    "The court clarified that Rule 23.1 applies to lawyers associated with a case, not just those who have formally filed a notice of appearance.",
    "The order puts Markus and all lawyers associated with the case on clear notice that their public statements fall under the rule's purview, with potential consequences including attorney discipline.",
    "The government did not seek discipline for Markus's prior op-ed, and the court declined to rule on whether it violated the rule due to potential prior lack of clarity."
