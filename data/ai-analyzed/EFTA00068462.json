    "Prosecution initially told defense there were approximately 2,100 'nude' or highly confidential images from Epstein's devices, but an FBI report indicated approximately 33,747 HC images and 895 HC videos - a major discrepancy.",
    "Defense requested access to all 'highly confidential' material minus child pornography, arguing that reviewing adult nudity only in government offices imposes extraordinary costs and impedes defense preparation.",
    "Thousands of photo files provided in discovery were unreadable by defense due to file format issues, corrupt spreadsheets, and lack of appropriate viewers.",
    "Prosecution defined 'Highly Confidential' as containing 'nude, partially-nude, or otherwise sexualized images, videos, or other depictions of individuals' and was working to de-designate images not depicting genitals, breasts, or buttocks.",
    "Evidence included images extracted from disks in black binders (approximately 40,000 images with 3,400 deemed HC) and from Epstein's devices searched pursuant to warrant."
