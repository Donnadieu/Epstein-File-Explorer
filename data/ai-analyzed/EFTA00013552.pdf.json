    "The document reveals urgent prosecution concerns in May 2008 that delays would cause the state statute of limitations to expire for five of the 16 known victims by Fall 2008.",
    "It states there are 'more than 20 known child victims' in the case, characterizing it as a child exploitation crime, not a non-violent white-collar crime.",
    "The prosecution references a 'state resolution' or plea deal Epstein had signed months prior, which required him to plead to uncharged crimes, and further delay would let him escape its terms.",
    "It notes victims have begun hiring private lawyers due to the delays, which Epstein's counsel could use to argue the victims are motivated by money.",
    "The grand jury hearing the case was reportedly 'invested and wants to indict' but was set to expire soon, adding time pressure."
