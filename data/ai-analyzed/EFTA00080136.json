    "The government disclosed its intent to call an expert witness, a trauma psychologist, to testify about patterns of sexual abuse, grooming, and victim behavior in the Ghislaine Maxwell case.",
    "The expert's expected testimony includes that perpetrators target vulnerable individuals, abuse often involves manipulation/coercion rather than forcible rape, and grooming behaviors build trust to obscure abuse.",
    "The expert is expected to testify that nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims, and that memory of trauma is impacted by surrounding circumstances.",
    "The government explicitly states the expert has not evaluated any specific victim in the case and her testimony will be general, based on her clinical experience and research.",
    "The letter reiterates the government's request for reciprocal discovery from the defense, including notice of any defense expert witnesses and related materials."
