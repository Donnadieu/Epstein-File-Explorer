    "An external tipster named Ugboma contacted the FBI in September 2020 claiming to have significant information about Epstein and Maxwell's assets and operational bases, with a focus on over forty sites in the UK.",

    "The tip references 'Faraday Education Limited', a UK company with director Damien McDonnell (OBE), claiming it was misclassified and has links to the Epstein/Maxwell network and Nigerian oil interests.",
    "The email chain shows FBI agents internally forwarding the tip for review by the Epstein/Maxwell case agents, with some skepticism about its validity ('jibberish', 'looks odd').",
    "The tipster asserts that either Epstein, Maxwell, or both conspired to leave a public trail of their exploits and associations, though the motive is unclear."
