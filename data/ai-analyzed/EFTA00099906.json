    "The court identified 'striking' disparities in legal resource access: Ghislaine Maxwell received 13 hours/day of electronic discovery access and 15 hours/week of video counsel visits, while Justin Rivera initially received 3 hours/day and 6 hours/week.",
    "The government's justification for the disparity hinges on Maxwell's unique protective custody housing at MDC (sole access to a room) versus Rivera's general population housing at MCC (shared facilities with ~80 other inmates).",
    "Judge Engelmayer raised concerns that the disparity in treatment between Maxwell and Rivera had poor 'optics' and prompted allegations of differential treatment based on race, gender, and class.",
    "By the date of the correspondence, the MCC had begun leaving a laptop with Rivera all day, purportedly matching Maxwell's level of electronic discovery access, though video conference access remained limited.",
    "The document reveals internal DOJ coordination to craft a response to judicial scrutiny over equitable treatment of high-profile versus other defendants in federal detention."
