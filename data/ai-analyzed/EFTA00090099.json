Engelmayer regarding a FOIA lawsuit brought by The New York Times against the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The letter transmits the government's first in-camera production of records related to Jeffrey Epstein, explains the redaction and withholding system used, and notes that many emails involving Tartaglione's defense counsel were collected due to the law firm's name containing 'Epstein' but may not be directly responsive to the Times's request.",

    "The government used a complex, dual-system color-coding scheme to mark redactions based on specific FOIA exemptions and related criminal cases (United States v. Tartaglione and United States v. Noel).",
    "The government suggests that many of the emails involving Tartaglione's defense counsel are not directly responsive to the Times's FOIA request about Jeffrey Epstein and may be withheld as they could interfere with the Tartaglione criminal case.",
    "This document is a procedural filing that reveals the methods and challenges of compiling and redacting a large production of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein from BOP records."
