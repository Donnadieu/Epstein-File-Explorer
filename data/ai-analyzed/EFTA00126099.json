    "Witness Frederico Rancier provides a first-hand account of the suicide attempt by an inmate (Epstein) in the MCC SHU, stating it occurred around 1:20-1:30am on a night when no midnight inmate check had been conducted.",
    "Rancier alleges correctional officers did not administer CPR to the inmate, who appeared dead with a blue skin tone, and handled him roughly, dropping him hard onto a stretcher.",
    "Rancier states a Lieutenant present had a video camera but initially pointed it at her leg, not at the cell, and only turned it toward the cell after the cell had been cleaned.",
    "Rancier reports that after the incident, procedures in the SHU changed: officers started bringing books to inmates, inmates had easier phone access, and regular inmate checks (12am, 3am, 5am) began.",
    "The document is an official FBI 302 report, indicating the FBI was investigating the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death/attempt in August 2019."
