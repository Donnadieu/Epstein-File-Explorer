    "The term 'grooming' was first introduced in the peer-reviewed professional literature on child sexual abuse in a 1984 article by John Conte.",
    "The recognition that many child sexual abuse cases involve acquaintances using non-forceful techniques (grooming/seduction) burst into public consciousness in the mid-1980s, partly due to media coverage of the McMartin and Father Gilbert Caudle cases.",
    "The article warns against two archaic and problematic uses of the term 'seduction': as a vague euphemism for any child-adult sexual contact, and as a concept blaming the child as the 'seducer' of the adult.",
    "The author argues against abandoning the term 'grooming' in favor of 'seduction' due to this historical baggage and suggests using the terms in tandem with clear explanation.",
    "The article notes the misuse of the term 'grooming' in civil litigation, where it is sometimes incorrectly applied to common, desirable behaviors to imply negligence by organizations."
