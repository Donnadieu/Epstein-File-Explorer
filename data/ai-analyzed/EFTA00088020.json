  "summary": "This document is an email chain from June 18, 2020, discussing the status of a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) request from the U.S. to the United Kingdom concerning a material witness, referred to as 'PA'. The emails detail a dispute between U.S. prosecutors and the UK Home Office/UK Central Authority (UKCA) over whether to proceed with the formal MLAT request or first exhaust voluntary cooperation avenues with the witness's legal team, Blackfords. The U.S. side argues voluntary efforts have failed due to a breakdown in trust and urges the UK to proceed with the MLAT.",
