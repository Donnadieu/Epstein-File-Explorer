  "summary": "This is an internal FBI email chain from January 10, 2020, discussing the status of surveillance video from outside Jeffrey Epstein's jail cell during his July 2019 suicide attempt. The emails reveal that the video stored on a DVR was corrupted and unrecoverable despite FBI lab efforts, and that prosecutors had been aware of this issue since November 2019. The chain includes forwarded news reports about the video's deletion and its implications.",
