  "summary": "This is a federal court opinion and order by Judge Kimba M. Wood in the criminal case against Dean Skelos and Adam Skelos. The order rules on motions to quash subpoenas served on non-parties, including the PRI Parties (Anthony Bonomo, Carl Bonomo, and related entities) and the Glenwood Parties (Charles Dorego, Glenwood Management Corp., and Steven Swarzman). The court grants the motions to quash the subpoenas served on the PRI Parties and partially grants/denies the motions regarding the Glenwood Parties, setting specific production deadlines. This is a court order (Document 323) from the criminal case United States v. Dean Skelos and Adam Skelos (1:15-cr-00317-KMW), filed by Judge Kimba M. Wood. The order rules on motions to quash subpoenas served on various third parties, including Charles Dorego, Glenwood Management, and Steven Swarzman, in relation to the upcoming trial. It details which subpoena requests are granted or denied, focusing on the relevance and admissibility of documents concerning potential kickbacks, business transactions, and communications to show witness bias or motive.",

    "The court granted motions to quash all subpoena requests served on the PRI Parties (Anthony Bonomo, Carl Bonomo, and related entities), finding the requests were overbroad, sought inadmissible hearsay, or sought documents obtainable through other means like Brady/Giglio disclosures.",
    "The court partially granted and partially denied motions to quash subpoenas served on the Glenwood Parties (Charles Dorego, Glenwood Management, Steven Swarzman), ordering production of some documents related to payments to Dorego by a specific deadline.",
    "Defendants sought documents from the PRI Parties to potentially impeach government witness Anthony Bonomo by showing he 'engaged in rampant fraud and other misconduct' in managing PRI.",
    "Defendants sought documents from Charles Dorego, Glenwood's general counsel, regarding payments he may have received from other non-parties, which they argued could show he received illegal kickbacks.",
    "The court applied the legal standard from United States v. Nixon to evaluate the subpoenas, emphasizing that Rule 17(c) is not a discovery tool but a mechanism for obtaining specific admissible evidence.",
    "The court found a basis for the defense's claim that Charles Dorego may have received kickbacks from Steven Swarzman, citing government notes stating 'Hundreds of thousands of dollars paid to Charlie Dorego out of these projects from Steven Swarzman.'",
    "Documents showing Dorego or Glenwood's ownership interest in AbTech could undermine Dorego's prior testimony that he helped Adam Skelos get a job there to distance Glenwood from favors, as it would mean Adam was hired at a company they owned.",
    "The court quashed subpoena requests deemed 'fishing expeditions,' including one for all documents on transactions between Swarzman, Dorego, McKenna, Dwyer, and their companies, finding it overly broad and not sufficiently focused.",
    "The court ordered a modified procedure for future Rule 17(c) subpoenas, requiring parties to submit requests to Chambers for signature and to provide notice to all parties unless a compelling reason exists for ex parte proceedings."
