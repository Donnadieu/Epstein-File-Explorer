    "Ghislaine Maxwell was in custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in July 2020, awaiting her arraignment.",
    "The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) preferred not to comment publicly on Maxwell's housing conditions, which included being in her own cell without a cellmate and having separate exercise time for security reasons.",
    "There was significant coordination and some confusion between the U.S. Attorney's Office, BOP/MDC staff, and Maxwell's defense counsel regarding the protocol for scheduling legal calls in the days leading to her court appearance.",
    "Defense counsel was receiving more call access (including two-hour afternoon calls) than typical for inmates prior to arraignment, according to BOP staff.",
    "The email chain reveals the logistical challenges and special accommodations considered for a high-profile defendant in federal custody."
