    "Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide via hanging in his SHU cell at MCC New York on the morning of August 10, 2019.",
    "A prior incident on July 23, 2019, where Epstein was found with a ligature, was investigated but deemed inconclusive regarding whether it was a suicide attempt, an assault, or a feigned incident.",
    "Despite clear psychology recommendations that Epstein required a cellmate while in SHU, he was left alone in his cell on the night of August 9-10 after his cellmate, Efrain Reyes, departed for court.",
    "The review found significant systemic failures: SHU officers failed to conduct required rounds and counts, the SENTRY database contained major inaccuracies, and there was a critical breakdown in communication regarding housing protocols.",
    "On August 9, 2019, Epstein was provided an unmonitored social phone call by the Institution Duty Officer, a fact the review team found 'extremely concerning' but could not investigate further.",
    "The document identifies a direct dereliction of duty by assigned correctional workers in the Special Housing Unit as the primary factor that exposed the institution to an inmate suicide event.",
    "Failure to perform basic correctional tasks like counting and viewing inmates is cited; had these been done, the suicide might have been detected or responded to quicker.",
    "The Institution Supplement on Suicide Prevention is noted as not required and occasionally not followed, indicating a systemic procedural failure.",
    "Recommendations include a multi-disciplinary team assessment, reinstating Regional Psychology Administrators, reviewing staff resource allocation, and establishing procedures for video-capable cells in the SHU.",
    "The document provides a cost/impact statement estimating over $10,000 in expenses related to the event, including medical and potential death-related costs."
