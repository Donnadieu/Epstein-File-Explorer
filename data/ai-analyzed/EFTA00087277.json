    "The SDNY possesses FBI investigative files from the SDFL Epstein investigation but deliberately avoided obtaining any files from the U.S. Attorney's Office in SDFL due to conflict issues, discovery issues, and to avoid appearing to step into the shoes of a district bound by a prior non-prosecution agreement.",
    "SDNY staff explicitly state they have no materials relating to purported immunity discussions for potential co-conspirators, assuming any such discussions were between defense counsel and the SDFL USAO.",
    "The Northern District of Georgia (NDGA) has 'stepped into the shoes' of SDFL for Epstein-related matters, indicating a transfer of jurisdictional responsibility.",
    "The email chain reveals internal debate and uncertainty about the proper procedure under Touhy regulations for referring requesters to another U.S. Attorney's Office, highlighting the complex inter-district coordination in the Epstein case.",
    "A grand jury subpoena was previously disclosed to a victim (Jane Doe) and was considered for production again in response to her Touhy request."
