    "The testifying officer admitted to 'dropping the ball' regarding the inaccurate count slips and failure to generate a new Electronic Entry (El) when discrepancies were known.",
    "Epstein was moved to an R&D holding cell at 3:15 pm on August 9, 2019, but the SHU never removed him from their inmate count, causing all subsequent SHU counts (4 pm, 10 pm, 12 am) to be inaccurate.",
    "A procedural change to save money had Internal Two officers leaving at 10 pm instead of midnight, which affected who was responsible for counts.",
    "Handwriting analysis on count slips is a focus, with the officer confirming some markings as his but expressing uncertainty about others, particularly a '+1' on a SHU slip.",
    "Control personnel may not have been notified of Epstein's move, so they did not make the necessary key entries to transfer him from the SHU to R&D in the system."
