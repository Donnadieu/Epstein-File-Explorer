    "A significant discrepancy exists in the number of 'Highly Confidential' nude/sexualized images: the prosecution initially stated ~2,100 from Epstein's devices, but an FBI report cited ~33,747 images and 895 videos.",
    "The defense reports major technical issues, with thousands of photo files being unreadable due to incompatible file formats and a corrupt Excel spreadsheet (SDNY_GM_00467566) containing metadata.",
    "The prosecution is refusing to provide copies of 'Highly Confidential' images/videos to the defense, citing a Protective Order, and will only allow review under law enforcement supervision, arguing the material contains nude images of victims and third parties.",
    "The defense argues that among the 'HC' material they reviewed, there was adult nudity but nothing they identified as child pornography, and they request access to all non-child pornography material for proper trial preparation.",
    "The email chain reveals ongoing, contentious discovery disputes that the defense indicates may need to be raised with the Court, highlighting impediments to constitutionally guaranteed evidence review."
