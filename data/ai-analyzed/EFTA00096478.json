  "keyFacts": [
    "Prosecutors initially told the defense there were approximately 2,100 'nude' or Highly Confidential images on a hard-drive from Epstein's devices, but an FBI report cited approximately 33,747 HC images and 895 HC videos, creating a major discrepancy.",
    "The defense argues that among the 'Highly Confidential' images they reviewed, there were nude/partially-nude photos of adults but nothing they identified as meeting the legal definition of child pornography.",
    "Thousands of photo files provided in discovery are unreadable by the defense due to incompatible file formats or corrupt files, severely impeding case preparation.",
    "The government is refusing to provide copies of nude/sexualized images to the defense, citing a Protective Order, and will only allow in-person review under law enforcement supervision.",
    "The email chain reveals extensive technical and procedural disputes over discovery access just months before the scheduled November 2021 trial."
