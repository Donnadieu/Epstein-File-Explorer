  "summary": "This document is an email chain between Assistant U.S. Attorneys from the Southern District of New York and Gary Bloxsome, a UK solicitor representing the Duke of York (Prince Andrew). The correspondence details negotiations over the Duke's potential cooperation with the U.S. investigation into Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, with the U.S. side seeking a voluntary interview and the Duke's legal team offering only a written witness statement limited to the 1994-1997 indictment period. The U.S. ultimately states it will proceed with a compelled interview request via the UK Central Authority.",
