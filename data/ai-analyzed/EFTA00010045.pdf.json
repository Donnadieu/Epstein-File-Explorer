    "The program allowed individuals who had previously settled with Epstein or whose claims were time-barred to participate and seek compensation.",
    "The protocol notes that individuals who allegedly assisted Epstein in procuring victims could be eligible if they acted under duress due to their own abuse by him.",
    "Accepting compensation required claimants to sign a release waiving future claims against Epstein's estate and related entities, but did not impose confidentiality rules on discussing their abuse."
