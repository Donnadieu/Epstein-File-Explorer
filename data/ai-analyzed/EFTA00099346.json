    "The report is titled 'Privilege Terms' and was generated on February 14, 2020, indicating an ongoing process of filtering evidence for attorney-client privileged communications during the investigation.",
    "The high hit counts for certain attorneys (e.g., Reid Weingarten with 6,162 hits, Lilly Sanchez with 5,282, Jay Lefkowitz with 5,054) suggest a massive volume of legal correspondence and documents were part of the evidence collection.",
    "The report methodology includes searching for terms 'including Family', likely referring to linguistic variations or related terms, which increased the total hit count for many searches."
