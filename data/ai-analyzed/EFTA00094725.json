  "summary": "This is a letter filed by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and 17 news media organizations, urging Judge Alison J. Nathan to deny Ghislaine Maxwell's request to seal the joint proposed juror questionnaire and voir dire in her criminal case. The letter argues that the First Amendment and common law create a presumptive right of public access to voir dire proceedings, and the defense has not met the heavy burden to justify sealing.",

    "The U.S. government consented to the defendant's sealing request.",
    "The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and 17 major news organizations formally opposed the sealing, arguing it violates the First Amendment and common law right of public access to criminal proceedings.",
    "The letter cites extensive legal precedent establishing a presumptive public right of access to voir dire and juror questionnaires.",
    "The defense's justification for sealing was deemed 'conclusory speculation' that media coverage 'may prejudice the jury selection process,' which the media coalition argues fails to meet the heavy burden required to overcome the presumption of openness."
