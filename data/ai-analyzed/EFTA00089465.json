    "Ghislaine Maxwell's bail appeal was denied by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on April 27, 2021.",
    "Maxwell's defense counsel alleged she was subjected to sleep disruption at MDC due to guards shining a flashlight into her cell every 15 minutes.",
    "The government stated the frequent checks were due to Maxwell being on an 'enhanced security schedule' because of the nature of charges, high-profile case, and her being housed alone.",
    "Judge Nathan denied the request to alter the flashlight protocol, finding it factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported, but urged MDC to consider reducing sleep disruption.",
    "Defense counsel claimed Maxwell suffered a black eye while in custody and suggested it might be related to her attempts to shield her eyes from the lights."
