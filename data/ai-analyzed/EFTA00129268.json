    "The document is a law enforcement report generated on August 14, 2019, in response to a subpoena for records related to Case ID 2019R01059.",
    "It details four specific online posts made on August 10, 2019, from two IP addresses (107.77.223.177 and 172.58.139.162), with timestamps between 08:16 and 08:47 EDT.",
    "The content of the posts, from an anonymous user, alleges that after a 4:15 AM count, Jeffrey Epstein was taken to medical in a wheelchair, an unlogged 'trip van' arrived without signing in, and a person in a 'green dress military outfit' was in the van, leading the poster to speculate 'they switched him out' before his reported suicide.",
    "One of the posts (222520257) was deleted later on August 10, 2019, but the report's deletion record indicates it was 'Cleared: this entry doesn't correspond to a deletion.'",
    "The report captures early online speculation and potential witness accounts regarding the circumstances of Jeffrey Epstein's death, which were of immediate interest to law enforcement."
