    "The U.S. Attorney's Office is conducting a criminal investigation into a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme involving J. Barry Thompson and Volantis entities, suspected of violating wire fraud and conspiracy statutes (18 U.S.C. §§ 1343 and 1349).",
    "The investigation focuses on transactions in June and July 2018 where victims, including Iterative Capital, paid millions in fiat currency for promised cryptocurrency that was never delivered.",
    "A sealed non-disclosure order was granted, prohibiting Iterative from notifying anyone (including the investigation targets) about the grand jury subpoena for one year, to prevent flight, evidence tampering, or jeopardizing the investigation.",
    "The subpoena specifically seeks all discovery, transcripts, and documents from Iterative's arbitration proceeding against Volantis, which Iterative won in November 2018.",
    "The government argues the targets have substantial financial means in cryptocurrency, facilitating potential flight, and that evidence is largely digital and easily destroyed if the investigation is revealed."
