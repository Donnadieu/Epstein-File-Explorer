    "The U.S. Attorney's Office was conducting an active, non-public grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and others for sex trafficking and enticement of minors as of February 2019.",
    "The investigation sought discovery materials from the civil lawsuit 'Jane Doe 43 v. Epstein, et al.', which were held by the plaintiffs' law firm, Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP.",
    "A protective order in the civil case was the only obstacle to the law firm complying with the grand jury subpoena, as the firm itself did not intend to contest it.",
    "The government argued that avoiding embarrassment is not a valid reason to uphold confidentiality against a legitimate law enforcement need, especially for crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors.",
    "The existence and scope of this criminal investigation in the Southern District of New York was not publicly known at the time, and Epstein and other subjects were believed to be unaware of it."
