    "The government had produced over 165,000 pages of discovery to Ghislaine Maxwell's defense within two weeks of the protective order being entered.",
    "The government strongly opposed disclosing the names of victim-witnesses 11 months before trial, citing victim privacy and lack of legal precedent.",
    "The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) was providing Maxwell extended access to discovery materials from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. daily at the MDC.",
    "The government expressed concern that Maxwell's defense counsel had referenced sealed discovery materials from the criminal case in a public civil court filing.",
    "The defense's request for court intervention in Maxwell's jail conditions was deemed moot by the government, as the BOP had already implemented a modified plan for her discovery access."
