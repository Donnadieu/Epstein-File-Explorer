  "summary": "This document contains a series of Bureau of Prisons psychology service clinical notes and a disciplinary process report for inmate Jeffrey Epstein from July 27-30, 2019, while he was held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York (MCC-NY). The notes detail his mental status, complaints about conditions in the Special Housing Unit (SHU), his inability to recall how he received neck injuries, and his eventual evaluation as competent to face disciplinary charges for attempted self-mutilation. This document contains Bureau of Prisons psychology service reports for inmate Jeffrey Epstein from July 31 to August 8, 2019. It includes a clinical contact note, a detailed suicide risk assessment, and a follow-up session. The reports document Epstein's mental status, his denial of suicidal ideation, and the investigation into an incident on July 23, 2019, where he was found with a string around his neck. The overall assessment concludes his acute suicide risk is low.",

    "Clinical notes detail Epstein's significant anxiety about returning to the SHU, complaints of severe sleep deprivation due to noise, and physical complaints including arm and neck numbness.",
    "Epstein suggested he 'may have something on the Autism spectrum,' comparing himself to a character in 'Rain Man' and noting an aversion to noise and being 'really good with numbers.'",
    "The documents show Epstein was frequently out of his cell for approximately 12 hours per day for legal visits with his attorneys, during which he also took meals.",

    "Epstein consistently denied recent and current suicidal ideation, planning, and intent during all evaluations in late July and early August 2019.",
    "The psychological assessment identified static risk factors for suicide including 'High Profile Crime', 'Lack of family connections', and 'Sex offender status', but concluded protective factors overrode them, resulting in a 'Low' overall acute suicide risk.",
    "Epstein reported that his 'friends and Lawyers are emotionally supportive' and that he planned to 'finish this case and to go back to his normal life.'"
