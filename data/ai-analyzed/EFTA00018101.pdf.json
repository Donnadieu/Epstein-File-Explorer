    "The DOJ Inspector General is investigating whether there was a policy violation or administrative failure in not providing Jeffrey Epstein with a cellmate at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC).",
    "The IG's investigation is being conducted under the 'IG Empowerment Act of 2016,' which grants the DOJ-IG access to all grand jury materials.",
    "There is a desire from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York that any report from the IG be released after the trial (presumably Ghislaine Maxwell's).",
    "The investigation involves reviewing witness statements, but the notes indicate that handwritten notes from at least one witness are not yet available.",
    "The document discusses two divisions within the IG's office handling the report with different approaches to naming individuals: the Oversight Review Division uses all names in long reports, while the Investigations Division uses titles instead of names."
