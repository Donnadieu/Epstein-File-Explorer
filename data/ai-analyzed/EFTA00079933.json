    "The FBI's New York Child Exploitation & Human Trafficking Task Force was actively investigating Ghislaine Maxwell as of early 2020, issuing a subpoena to Expedia for her travel records.",
    "Expedia's search of its databases using the email addresses provided by the FBI yielded no booking records for Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "Expedia's policy required specific identifiers like email addresses, credit card numbers, or itinerary numbers to locate customer records, as their databases did not use date of birth for identification.",
    "The FBI's request was ultimately closed by Expedia in March 2020 due to lack of follow-up information from the FBI after the initial 30-day period.",
    "The correspondence shows standard law enforcement-corporate procedures for handling subpoenas and highlights the challenges of locating digital records without precise identifiers."
