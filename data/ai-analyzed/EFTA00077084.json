  "summary": "This is a letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York to Judge Alison J. Nathan regarding the proposed protective order in the case against Ghislaine Maxwell. The government opposes two specific requests from the defense: (1) to publicly name and identify victims who have spoken publicly about Epstein or Maxwell, and (2) to impose restrictions on the government's use of its own investigative materials. The government argues for protecting victim privacy under the Crime Victims' Rights Act.",

  "keyFacts": [
    "The government strongly opposes the defense's request to publicly name victims who have ever spoken about Epstein or Maxwell in any public forum, calling it 'extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate.'",
    "The government's proposed protective order would allow the defense to reference victim identities in private conversations with potential witnesses and in sealed filings, but not in public statements.",
    "The government argues victim privacy is protected under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (18 U.S.C. § 3771), which includes the right to be protected from the accused and to have dignity and privacy respected.",
    "The defense also sought to restrict the government's use of its own investigative documents when sharing them with witnesses, a request the government calls 'unprecedented' and 'without legal basis.'",
    "The document reveals a strategic conflict where the defense seeks to publicly name victims, potentially to discourage cooperation, while the government seeks to shield them from public scrutiny and harassment."
