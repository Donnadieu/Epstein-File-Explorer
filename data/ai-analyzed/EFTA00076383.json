  "summary": "This is a court filing from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, specifically an appendix volume containing documents related to the civil case against Ghislaine Maxwell. It includes a district court order denying Maxwell's motion to reconsider the unsealing of deposition transcripts, a notice of appeal, a sealed declaration, and a letter from Maxwell's counsel requesting a stay of the unsealing process due to new information in the parallel criminal case. This document contains multiple parts: (1) a letter from Ghislaine Maxwell's counsel to Judge Preska regarding the unsealing protocol in the civil case, (2) a protective order from the criminal case against Maxwell, (3) an order from Judge Preska denying Maxwell's request for a stay of unsealing, and (4) transcripts from two hearings (2016 and 2020) in the civil defamation case. The materials center on discovery disputes, protective orders, and the process of unsealing court records. This is a transcript of a court hearing before Judge Alison J. Nathan regarding the unsealing of numerous documents in the civil litigation related to Jeffrey Epstein. The hearing details specific docket entries, including depositions of Ghislaine Maxwell and various Jane/John Does, that are to be unsealed, partially unsealed, or remain sealed. The hearing concludes with Maxwell's attorney requesting a stay to appeal the unsealing order to the Second Circuit, citing Maxwell's recent indictment and concerns about a fair trial.",
