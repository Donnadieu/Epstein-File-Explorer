The work includes an engine inlet rivet repair and the installation of an ADS-B Out system. The records show the involvement of maintenance companies Constant Aviation and Nextant Aerospace, and certification by FAA designees. This is a technical document titled 'Instructions for Continued Airworthiness for the Installation of ADS-B Out on Part 25 Aircraft' (Report No. 584-00-0047, Revision D). It is a proprietary manual from BHE & Associates, Ltd., detailing the installation, inspection, and maintenance procedures for ADS-B Out systems on various private jet models. The document is approved by the FAA via ODA VT-DRB Aviation Consultants. This document is a technical manual titled 'Instructions for Continued Airworthiness' (Report No. 584-00-0047, Rev: D) issued by BHE & Associates, Ltd.

This document is an FAA Form 337 detailing the installation of avionics equipment on the aircraft with registration N493LX. It lists specific parts, weights, and arm measurements, and is dated May 30, 2013. It appears to be a technical record related to the modification of an aircraft. This document is a collection of FAA forms, Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs), and related technical records detailing major repairs, alterations, and certifications performed on a Raytheon/Beechcraft 400A aircraft, registration N493LX, owned by Flight Options LLC. The work was performed and certified by Nextant Aerospace LLC and involves engine replacement, avionics upgrades, and interior refurbishments. This document consists of FAA Form 337 (Major Repair and Alteration) and Form 8110-3 (Statement of Compliance) records for aircraft N493LX (serial RK-244), a Raytheon/Beechcraft 400A owned by Flight Options LLC. The forms detail several modifications performed by Nextant Aerospace in late 2012 and 2013, including structural alterations to the baggage area, installation of new pitot probes, and cockpit provisions, all certified by an FAA Designated Engineering Representative. This document is a collection of FAA Form 337 and Form 8110-3 records detailing major repairs and alterations performed on a Hawker Beechcraft 400A aircraft, registration N493LX, serial number RK-244. The work was performed by Nextant Aerospace for the owner, Flight Options LLC, between 2012 and 2013, covering modifications to electrical systems, structures, and avionics. This is a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Statement of Compliance with Airworthiness Standards for a Hawker Beechcraft 400A aircraft (S/N RK-244). The document approves engineering data to support a repair procedure for the horizontal stabilizer, submitted by Nextant Aerospace. This document is an FAA Form 337 (Major Repair and Alteration) for aircraft N493LX, a Beechjet 400A (serial RK-244), owned by Flight Options, LLC. It details an interior refurbishment and modification, including the installation of a 3-place divan, performed by Constant Aviation in December 2013. The form is supported by engineering compliance statements and a structural analysis report from Lee Products Engineering Services, Inc., certifying the work meets FAA regulations. This document is a collection of FAA Form 8110-3 Statements of Compliance and related maintenance instructions for a Beechjet 400A aircraft (S/N RK-244). It details approvals for structural modifications and interior cabin configurations, specifically a 3-place divan assembly, to meet airworthiness standards. The documents are associated with a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) and involve the company Constant Aviation and Aviation Fabricators Inc. This is a technical installation and maintenance manual (ICA Document No. AF-528) for a three-place divan (couch) assembly with a restraint system, likely for installation in an aircraft cabin. It details inspection requirements, dimensions, placards, and service instructions. The document is from Aviation Fabricators Inc. in Clinton, MO, and is relevant to the Epstein case as it likely pertains to modifications made to one of his private aircraft. This document is a collection of FAA forms related to the airworthiness certification and operating limitations for a Raytheon Model 400A aircraft, registration N493LX, serial number RK-244. It includes a Statement of Compliance, an Application for Airworthiness Certificate, and a Special Airworthiness Certificate with detailed operating limitations issued for 'Research and Development' purposes. The aircraft is owned by Flight Options LLC and the limitations restrict its use to essential personnel only, prohibiting carrying persons or property for compensation or hire. This document set contains FAA forms, letters, and certificates related to the re-certification of a Beechjet 400A (serial RK-244, registration N493LX) from a standard to an experimental airworthiness certificate for research and development purposes. The aircraft is owned by Flight Options LLC and Nextant Aerospace, LLC is authorized as an agent. The documents detail the program purpose, operating limitations, and authorizations. This document is an FAA Form 337 detailing a major repair and alteration to the Beech Jet 400A aircraft with registration N493LX, owned by Flight Options LLC. It includes a program letter and a special airworthiness certificate for research and development flight testing, authorizing the aircraft for specific experimental purposes. This document is a collection of FAA forms, supplemental type certificates (STCs), and engineering orders related to the modification and maintenance of aircraft N493LX, a Raytheon (Hawker Beechcraft) 400A.
