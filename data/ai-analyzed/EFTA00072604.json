    "Prosecutors determined they 'almost certainly couldn't bring an enticement charge' based on timing and location facts related to a victim's case.",
    "A victim interviewed in California was still not sure whether she wanted to pursue a criminal case; her attorneys were to be circled back with later in November 2019.",
    "The victim did not want to discuss specific conduct during the California meeting, so no additional information was obtained.",
    "Prosecutors were continuing to work on a 'pile of memos' and had scheduled a limited proffer session with another individual for the following week.",
    "The email chain shows internal coordination among prosecutors (USANYS) in November 2019 to discuss case updates."
