    "The government opposes Ghislaine Maxwell's subpoena for Minor Victim-2's entire teenage diary, arguing it is irrelevant, overbroad, and barred by Rule 17(h).",
    "The government acknowledges Minor Victim-2's diary contains no references to Ghislaine Maxwell, a fact both sides agree on and the victim will testify to.",
    "The government is working to obtain a pair of boots (purchased by Maxwell and Epstein for the victim) via the FBI to make them available to the defense, potentially mooting that request.",
    "The government has already produced copies of the photographs Maxwell seeks and argues her request for the originals lacks justification.",
    "The legal argument centers on the Nixon standard for Rule 17(c) subpoenas, requiring relevancy, admissibility, and specificity, which the government claims Maxwell's requests fail to meet."
