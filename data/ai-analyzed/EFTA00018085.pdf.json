  "keyFacts": [
    "In November 2020, Ghislaine Maxwell's defense attorney alleged her isolation cell at MDC Brooklyn was subject to 'cold, moisture, and sewage stench,' making confinement 'unhealthy, unbearable, and utterly unreasonable.'",
    "The defense claimed Maxwell's requests for an extra blanket, a mug for water, and to keep a snack in her cell had been denied, and she was told to 'cup her hands to drink water from the faucet.'",
    "MDC staff conducted an inspection in response, finding cell temperature between 71-74°F (target was 68°F), no observed smell/moisture, and gave Maxwell an extra blanket, bringing her total to three.",
    "Attorney Bobbi Sternheim stated that in her 35-year career representing terrorism and capital murder defendants, she had 'never witnessed such inappropriate and outlandish treatment of a non-violent pretrial detainee.'",
    "The email chain shows a direct conflict between the defense's allegations of mistreatment and the Bureau of Prisons' official account of conditions."
