  "summary": "This is a legal memorandum filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense attorneys in support of a motion to dismiss the superseding indictment against her. The motion argues that the indictment was obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment because the grand jury was drawn from the White Plains Division during the COVID-19 pandemic, which allegedly systematically underrepresented Black and Hispanic residents compared to the Manhattan Division where the alleged crimes occurred.",
