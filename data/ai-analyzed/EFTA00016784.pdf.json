    "The legal opinion argues the key question is whether France may extradite a French national under the U.S.-France Extradition Treaty, not under French domestic law alone.",
    "The opinion contends the 2007 Peterson case is not a valid legal precedent because it was a discretionary ministerial decision, not a published judicial ruling, and the U.S. did not challenge the refusal in French courts.",
    "Article 3 of the U.S.-France Extradition Treaty gives France discretion, but does not preclude, the extradition of its own citizens to the U.S.",
    "The opinion states that if Ghislaine Maxwell signed an irrevocable waiver in the U.S., it is 'highly unlikely' the French government would refuse to extradite her.",
    "The 2010 EU-U.S. Extradition Agreement must be considered in any modern extradition request, which post-dates the Peterson case."
