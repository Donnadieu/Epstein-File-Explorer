    "The Manhattan District Attorney's Office (DANY) is investigating Leon Black for an alleged sexual assault in NYC in 2001.",
    "The victim in the investigation was also trafficked by Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, linking the case to the broader Epstein network.",
    "DANY's investigation is limited to one incident in NYC; other conduct and potential targets fall outside their jurisdictional scope.",
    "The victim has recently retained attorney Jeanne, who is willing to share more information with prosecutors.",
    "DANY finds the victim credible partly due to similarities in the alleged sexual assault (biting) to other cases, but charges seem unlikely due to lack of corroboration."
