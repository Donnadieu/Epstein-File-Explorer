    "The FBI was actively working with multiple Epstein victims in the New York City area on victim compensation applications in August-September 2019.",
    "Compensation for victims required a letter from the District Attorney or U.S. Attorney's Office (SDNY) stating they would have prosecuted Epstein if the case had been brought timely.",
    "An FBI agent expressed anger about 'what happened over the weekend,' which strongly implies Epstein's death in August 2019 was a significant emotional event within the investigation team.",
    "The email chain shows internal FBI coordination between field agents and the Victim Services Division regarding post-Epstein death victim support."
