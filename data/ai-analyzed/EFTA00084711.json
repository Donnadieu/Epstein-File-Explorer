  "summary": "This is a letter from Ghislaine Maxwell's defense attorney, Bobbi C. Sternheim, to Judge Alison J. Nathan. The letter renews a request for the early release of potential juror names to counsel (for attorneys' eyes only) to allow for proper background research before voir dire. It argues that withholding names until jury selection would deprive Maxwell of her right to a fair and impartial jury, citing legal precedents and bar association opinions on the importance of juror vetting.",

    "Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team is formally requesting the court to release the names of 600 potential jurors to counsel upon completion of questionnaires, not at voir dire, to allow for proper background research.",
    "The defense argues that withholding juror names until jury selection would violate Maxwell's right to a fair and impartial jury and due process, citing the risk of undisclosed juror bias.",
    "The letter cites the precedent of United States v. Parse (Daugerdas), where a juror's lies during voir dire led to a vacated conviction after a three-month trial, to underscore the importance of pre-voir dire research.",
    "The defense compares the case to Sines v. Kessler, a high-profile civil case involving alleged white supremacists, where the court released juror names to counsel, arguing juror privacy concerns are greater in that case.",
    "The document references formal opinions from the New York City Bar Association and American Bar Association stating that internet research on potential jurors is an expected standard of competent legal practice."
