    "Ghislaine Maxwell's access to the materials is severely restricted; she may only review hard copies in the presence of her defense counsel and electronic copies as provided by the Bureau of Prisons.",
    "The order prohibits the public filing of victim or witness identities from the discovery unless those individuals have already identified themselves publicly on the record in the case.",
    "The order outlines strict protocols for who can receive the materials (Defense Counsel, staff, experts, potential witnesses) and requires them to sign an agreement to be bound by its terms."
