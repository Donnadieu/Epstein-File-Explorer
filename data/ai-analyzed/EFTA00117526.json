    "The OIG is investigating allegations that BOP Captain instructed CO Tova Noel to falsify training records by signing sign-in sheets for SHU quarterly training and suicide prevention training in June 2019 without actually receiving the training.",
    "Captain vehemently denies the allegations, stating he only told Noel she needed to complete the training and coordinated with the SHU Lieutenant to provide it. He claims he never handed her the sign-in sheets or told her to sign them.",
    "Noel, under oath in a prior interview, stated with clarity that Captain specifically instructed her to sign the documents for a 'program review,' told her not to date them, and did not provide any training.",
    "The Captain explains that as the administrative lieutenant, he scheduled training and maintained the sign-in sheets in a binder in his office, but the SHU Lieutenant was responsible for conducting the training and having employees sign.",
    "The interview reveals a direct contradiction under oath between the accounts of Captain and CO Tova Noel regarding who instructed her to sign the training documents, a key element of the OIG's investigation into potential misconduct at MCC."
