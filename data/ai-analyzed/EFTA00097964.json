  "summary": "This is a letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York to Judge Alison J. Nathan, outlining the government's plan to obtain and review investigative files from the prior Florida investigation into Jeffrey Epstein (2005-2010) for potential disclosure in the Ghislaine Maxwell case. It details the legal framework for disclosure obligations and lists six specific sources of Florida-related files the prosecution team is reviewing. This is a government court filing from October 7, 2020, addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan. It details the prosecution's planned approach to reviewing materials from prior investigations (specifically the USAO-SDFL Florida investigation and USAO-SDGA's involvement in CVRA civil litigation) for potential Giglio and 3500 material relevant to the Ghislaine Maxwell prosecution. The government asserts these other offices are not part of the current prosecution team but commits to targeted reviews of specific email sets.",
