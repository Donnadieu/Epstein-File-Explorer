    "Ghislaine Maxwell was housed in protective custody at MDC with sole access to a room for approximately 13 hours a day for computer/phone use, while Justin Rivera was in general population at MCC sharing facilities with about 80 other inmates.",
    "Maxwell's case involved 'multiple times more discovery' than Rivera's, justifying greater access needs.",
    "The MCC began leaving a laptop with Rivera all day for charging only at night, effectively matching Maxwell's electronic discovery access at MDC.",
    "Judge Engelmayer described the disparity in access between Maxwell and Rivera as 'strikingly different' with 'terrible' optics, prompting the court order for an explanatory declaration.",
    "Rivera's defense counsel suggested the disparities were due to race, gender, and class differences, which the prosecution sought to counter with logistical and case-specific explanations."
