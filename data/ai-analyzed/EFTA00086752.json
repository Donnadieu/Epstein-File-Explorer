    "Ghislaine Maxwell was housed in protective custody at the MDC with sole access to a room for computer/phone use ~13 hours/day, while Justin Rivera was in general population at the MCC sharing a VTC room with ~80 other inmates.",
    "Maxwell's case involved 'multiple times more discovery' than Rivera's, justifying greater electronic access needs.",
    "The MCC began leaving a laptop with Rivera all day for charging, effectively matching Maxwell's electronic discovery access, but VTC access remained limited to avoid compromising other inmates.",
    "Judge Engelmayer described the disparity in access as 'strikingly different' with 'terrible' optics, and defense counsel suggested differential treatment based on race, gender, and class.",
    "The government's explanation centered on specific circumstances: case discovery volume, attorney requests, and individual housing situations at different facilities (MDC vs. MCC)."
