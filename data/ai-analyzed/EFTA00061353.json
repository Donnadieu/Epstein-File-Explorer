    "Multiple inmates have 'Separatee Warnings' and specific security cautions, indicating they must be kept apart from certain other individuals.",
    "One inmate, Samuel Ceruti, has extensive NYCDOC restrictions noted, including no phone calls except to a lawyer, 23-hour lockdown, gang affiliation, and a charge of witness tampering.",
    "The document's significance to the Epstein case is minimal; it appears to be a standard administrative record from the federal detention system."
