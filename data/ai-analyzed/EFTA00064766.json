    "The legal analysis cites the Epstein deal as being orchestrated to accede to his lawyers' requests for secrecy, contrasting it with the ideal of objective, justice-seeking prosecution.",
    "The commentary argues that while prosecutorial discretion is necessary for individualized justice, the Epstein case represents a 'glitch' where the system failed, potentially due to the defendant's power and connections.",
    "The article places the Epstein prosecution in the broader context of legal ethics, citing authorities like Bennett Gershman and Robert H. Jackson on the dangers and proper exercise of prosecutorial power."
