  "summary": "This is a mortgage document for a property located at 116 East 65th Street, New York, NY, securing a loan of $9,045,000 from Citibank, N.A. The mortgage is recorded under MERS as the mortgagee of record. It details the terms, borrower obligations, and property description. This document is a standard mortgage security instrument (deed of trust) outlining the borrower's obligations regarding escrow payments, property insurance, maintenance, and default conditions. It appears to be a generic loan document, not directly related to Epstein case events, but part of a financial records dataset. This document is a mortgage security instrument and adjustable rate rider for a property in New York, NY 10066-7007, dated April 14, 2018. It outlines the loan terms, borrower obligations, lender rights, and details an adjustable interest rate tied to LIBOR, with Citibank, N.A. as the lender. It is a standard loan document, not directly referencing Epstein case events or individuals. This document is an 'Interest Only Period Adjustable Rate Rider' for a mortgage note, detailing the terms for interest rate adjustments, payment calculations, and limits on rate changes. It appears to be a standard financial form with no direct mention of Epstein case individuals or events.",
