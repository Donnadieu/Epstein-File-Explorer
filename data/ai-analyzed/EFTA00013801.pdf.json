    "The defense refutes the prosecution's characterization of their arguments, stating they never claimed Epstein's conduct was 'innocuous' but argued that witness testimony was sensationalized, many minors lied about their age, and the sexual conduct did not meet federal criminal elements.",
    "The defense asserts the prosecution unilaterally modified the Deferred Prosecution Agreement and imposed an impossible deadline for compliance while refusing to provide necessary factual allegations for the required state plea.",
    "The defense reveals a conflict-of-interest where an AUSA proposed her live-in boyfriend's former law-school roommate, Humberto Ocariz, as the attorney representative for victims, leading to the selection being assigned to an independent third party."
