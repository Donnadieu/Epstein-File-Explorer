  "summary": "This document contains a subpoena issued to AT&T for subscriber information and records related to an ongoing investigation. It includes instructions for compliance and emphasizes the confidentiality of the request. The document also outlines the legal obligations of AT&T in relation to the subpoena. This document appears to contain call detail records and financial information related to various individuals, possibly in connection with the Epstein case. It includes timestamps and call durations, but lacks clear narrative context or named individuals due to the garbled text. This document contains billing records from AT&T, including call details and data transfer logs associated with various accounts. It includes an affidavit from Carol Gilligan, a Legal Compliance Analyst at AT&T, verifying the authenticity of the records. The document is subject to a protective order.",
