  "summary": "This is an email from Chris DiIonno forwarding a formal appeal regarding the denial of a covered action (2015-016/Knight Capital TCR & Appendix). The email alleges a miscarriage of justice in the sentencing of Dan Kamensky, claims a corrupt relationship between the SEC and Handler/Jefferies, and details multiple alleged frauds involving UBS, SEC LA, and various shell companies, accusing SEC officials of obstruction and protection of these frauds. This document is a lengthy email from whistleblower Christopher Dilorio to the SEC OWB, appealing the denial of his award claim for the Oppenheimer AML covered action (2015-016). He alleges the SEC used his information from his 2013 TCR (Tip, Complaint, or Referral) to bring the Oppenheimer/Gibraltar complaint but obstructed a full investigation to protect entities like Knight/NITE, UBS, and Hanover/Magna. He details a complex web of alleged money laundering through penny stock shells, naked shorting, and SEC corruption, implicating numerous individuals and entities.",

    "The author alleges Judge Cote's sentencing of Dan Kamensky was a 'gross miscarriage of justice' and that Kamensky was set up by Handler and Ressler because his successful bid for Neiman Marcus would have harmed Ares Management's investment.",
    "The document claims a 'long standing and grossly corrupt relationship' exists between the SEC and the financial firms Handler/Jefferies.",
    "The author, a self-identified whistleblower, accuses SEC officials (Norberg, Mckessy, Hoecker) of 'criminal obstruction' for using an 'illegally enacted' rule to deny awards and for failing to shut down UBS's cross-border business after a 2010 DPA was dropped.",
    "Multiple alleged frauds and shell companies (e.g., Viper Networks, Santeon Group, International Land Alliance) are detailed, with accusations that SEC LA officials (Searles, Banerjee) are protecting these operations and UBS San Diego.",
    "The email serves as a formal appeal and compendium of allegations tying together separate cases (Kamensky, UBS, various shell companies) under a theme of systemic corruption and obstruction within the SEC and related courts.",
    "The whistleblower, Christopher Dilorio, alleges the SEC used his information from a 2013 TCR to bring the Oppenheimer/Gibraltar AML enforcement action but then obstructed a full investigation to protect major players like Knight Capital/NITE and UBS.",
    "Dilorio claims Knight Capital (NITE) was insolvent as early as 2011 and that its core business was abusive naked shorting of OTC market shells to facilitate money laundering, a practice he says continues under Virtu Financial (VIRT).",
    "A key piece of evidence cited is a 2013 CGFIA 10-Q filing that disclosed a DTCC \"Global Lock\" due to a third-party broker-dealer's actions, which Dilorio asserts is incontrovertible proof of naked shorting that the SEC ignored.",
    "Dilorio alleges a deep network of connected individuals and entities involved in money laundering through penny stock shells, including figures linked to Michael Milken, such as Terren Peizer, and entities like Hanover/Magna, Alpha Capital Anstalt, and AQR blank check shells.",
    "The document accuses the SEC Office of the Whistleblower and Inspector General Carl Hoecker of gross misconduct, including failing to properly distribute his information, denying his award on fabricated grounds, and obstructing congressional oversight."
