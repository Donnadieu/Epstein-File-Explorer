    "Larry Visoski, Epstein's pilot from 1991-2019, states that around 2008/2009, and more definitively around 2010/2011, Epstein instructed him and co-pilot Dave Rodgers to stop recording passenger names on flight manifests, listing only Epstein.",
    "Flight records (passenger manifests and logs) were originally kept in the Palm Beach office, then transferred to the New York office, and in the mid-2000s, originals were turned over to Epstein's attorney Jack Goldberger.",
    "Visoski confirms that Dave Rodgers maintained a personal pilot logbook that included a column for passenger names, and that these logs became public on the internet around 2008.",
    "During the interview, Visoski reviewed specific flights from the 1990s, identifying frequent passengers like Ghislaine Maxwell and Eva Andersson, but often could not recall the identities of other passengers listed only by initials or first names.",
    "Visoski indicates that for international flights, pilots were required to know passenger names, but for domestic flights, they were sometimes only concerned with headcounts and weights."
