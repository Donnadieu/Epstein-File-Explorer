    "The court ruled Maxwell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in documents produced in civil litigation, even under a protective order, and thus their acquisition did not violate the Fourth Amendment.",
    "The court held that a civil protective order provides no guarantee against the use of testimony in a subsequent criminal case, so Maxwell's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was not violated.",
    "The court found Maxwell failed to make a substantial showing that the government deliberately misled the court when seeking modification of the protective order, so no due process violation occurred.",
    "Much of the evidence obtained, including Maxwell's deposition transcripts, had already been unsealed and made public by court order in the civil case by the time of this opinion."
