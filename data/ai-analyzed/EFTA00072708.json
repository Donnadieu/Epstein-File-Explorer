  "keyFacts": [
    "French law absolutely prohibits the extradition of any person who had French nationality at the time of the alleged crimes, regardless of any other nationalities they may hold.",
    "France applies the principle 'aut dedere, aut judicare' (either extradite or prosecute), meaning if France refuses extradition based on nationality, it must prosecute the individual itself for acts committed abroad.",
    "The U.S.-France extradition treaty (1996) explicitly allows France to refuse extradition of its nationals, while granting the U.S. Executive Branch the discretionary power to extradite U.S. nationals.",
    "The only exception to France's non-extradition rule is for member states of the European Union, due to the European Arrest Warrant framework established in 2002/2004.",
    "The document highlights a key legal asymmetry: the U.S. can and does extradite its nationals to France, but France systematically refuses to extradite French nationals to the U.S."
