    "Prosecutors considered but faced 'negative reaction' to charging an assault with a specific individual as the victim because she was 'considered one of the main perpetrators of the offenses' they planned to charge.",
    "The proposed federal plea deal involved Epstein pleading guilty to two charges: violating a child victim's privacy (18 U.S.C. § 403) and simple assault on a person over 16 on an aircraft (18 U.S.C. § 113(a)(5)).",
    "The parties agreed to jointly recommend a sentence of 18 months' imprisonment, 2 years of supervised release, and a $200,000 fine for the federal charges.",
    "Epstein also agreed to plead guilty to a state charge of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, with a binding joint recommendation for a 30-month sentence (20 months prison, 10 months community control).",
    "The U.S. agreed to provide Epstein's attorneys with a list of identified victims (not to exceed 40) after sentencing and to appoint a guardian ad litem for them."
