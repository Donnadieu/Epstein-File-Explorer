  "keyFacts": [
    "Prosecutors were actively subpoenaing airlines (United, American, Delta, Alaska, Southwest, JetBlue, Airline Reporting Corp) and Expedia in February 2020 for travel records related to Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "Expedia required additional identifiers like email addresses, credit card numbers, or itinerary numbers for searches, as their databases lacked date of birth information; initial searches returned negative results.",
    "The investigation faced timing pressure, with prosecutors wanting subpoena results reviewed before traveling to California for the case.",
    "JetBlue was not served with a subpoena because confidentiality was not confirmed with them, and it was noted JetBlue did not begin flying until 2000, making it less relevant for 1990s timeline searches."
