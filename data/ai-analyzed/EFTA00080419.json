  "summary": "This is a court order by Judge Alison J. Nathan granting a short continuance of Ghislaine Maxwell's trial from July 2021 to fall 2021. The continuance is granted due to the government's late filing of an S2 Superseding Indictment, which added new charges and an alleged victim, requiring significant additional defense preparation. The order balances the defense's need for time against the interests of the defendant, victims, and the public in a timely trial.",

    "The S2 Superseding Indictment extended the timeframe of the alleged conspiracies from through 1997 to 2004 and identified a fourth alleged victim, referred to as Minor Victim-4.",

    "The court granted a continuance until fall 2021, rejecting both Maxwell's alternative request for January 2022 and the Government's proposal for March 2022.",
    "The continuance was granted due to the significant new burden on the defense from the S2 indictment and ongoing complications from the COVID-19 pandemic on trial preparation.",
    "The order emphasizes the need to balance the defense's preparation time against the defendant's pretrial detention and the public/victims' interest in a timely trial."
