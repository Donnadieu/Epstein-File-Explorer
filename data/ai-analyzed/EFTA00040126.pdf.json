    "Ghislaine Maxwell's defense sought to subpoena the Epstein Victim's Compensation Program for documents related to four accusers (referred to as Accuser-1, Accuser-2, Accuser-4, and Witness-3) who received millions in compensation.",
    "The motion reveals specific settlement amounts: Accuser-1 received $5,000,000, Accuser-2 received $1,500,000, Witness-3 received $3,250,000, and Accuser-4 received $3,500,000 from the fund.",
    "The defense argues the compensation creates a financial motive for the accusers to testify, making the claim forms and related documents critical for impeachment to show bias.",
    "The motion states that lawyers for Accuser-2 and Witness-3 were instrumental in creating the terms of the Victim Compensation Program's Protocol.",
    "The defense claims the Protocol rewards accusers if prosecutions against Epstein's employees (like Maxwell) move forward, suggesting the accusers had a financial interest in Maxwell's conviction."
