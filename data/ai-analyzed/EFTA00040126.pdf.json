    "Four accusers in the indictment against Ghislaine Maxwell received millions from the Epstein Victim's Compensation Fund: Accuser-1 ($5M), Accuser-2 ($1.5M), Witness-3 ($3.25M), and Accuser-4 ($3.5M).",
    "Maxwell's defense argues the compensation fund's protocol rewards accusers who have filed lawsuits or claims against Epstein or his estate, including employees, creating potential bias if Maxwell's prosecution proceeds.",
    "The motion seeks to subpoena specific documents from the compensation program administrator, including claim forms, correspondence, payment checks, and release forms, for impeachment at trial.",

    "The defense contends that without these documents, full cross-examination of the accusers regarding potential economic motives is impossible, violating Maxwell's confrontation rights."
