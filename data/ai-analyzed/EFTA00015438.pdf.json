  "summary": "This is a declaration by Russell Capone, Counsel to the Acting U.S. Attorney for the SDNY, filed in support of the Bureau of Prisons' motion for summary judgment in a FOIA lawsuit brought by The New York Times. The declaration argues that records related to Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration and death at the Metropolitan Correctional Center should be withheld under FOIA exemptions, primarily because their release could interfere with the pending prosecutions of correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, and inmate Nicholas Tartaglione. This is a declaration filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in response to a FOIA request, arguing for withholding documents under Exemption 7(A) to prevent interference with ongoing prosecutions, specifically those of Tartaglione, Noel, and Thomas. It cites risks of influencing potential jurors and contributing to speculation about Epstein's death. This is a federal indictment against correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas for conspiracy and making false records related to their failure to perform inmate counts and rounds at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) on August 9-10, 2019, the night Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide. The document details their dereliction of duty, falsification of count slips, and the timeline leading to the discovery of Epstein's body. This is a superseding indictment from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Nicholas Tartaglione. It charges him with 17 counts related to a narcotics conspiracy, multiple murders, kidnapping, and firearms offenses stemming from events in April 2016. This document is a superseding indictment from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against defendant Nicholas Tartaglione. It details special findings related to multiple counts of murder and kidnapping resulting in death, specifically concerning victims Martin Luna, Urbano Santiago, Miguel Luna, and Hector Gutierrez, in connection with drug trafficking crimes.",

  "keyFacts": [
    "The document is a legal declaration arguing for the withholding of BOP records on Epstein's incarceration to avoid interfering with the prosecutions of correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, and inmate Nicholas Tartaglione.",
    "Nicholas Tartaglione was Jeffrey Epstein's cellmate in the MCC's Special Housing Unit in July 2019, including on the date of Epstein's apparent suicide attempt (July 23, 2019).",
    "The declaration details two key incidents: Epstein's apparent suicide attempt on July 23, 2019, and his death by suicide on August 10, 2019.",
    "The government argues that releasing records like inmate count logs, medical reports, and internal emails could influence witness testimony and prejudice potential jurors in the pending cases.",
    "The Tartaglione defense has put the conditions of his confinement and his interactions with Epstein at issue, particularly for a potential penalty phase, making records of their time as cellmates sensitive.",
    "The U.S. Attorney's Office is withholding documents related to Jeffrey Epstein under FOIA Exemption 7(A), claiming release would interfere with ongoing prosecutions of Tartaglione, Noel, and Thomas.",
    "The declaration argues that detailing associations between Tartaglione and Epstein could influence potential jurors and risk a fair trial, especially for any required sentencing hearings.",
    "Media speculation about Epstein's death is cited as a key reason why segregating non-exempt information is difficult, as releasing partial information could fuel further speculation and prejudice juries.",
    "The filing was executed by Russell Capone, Counsel to the Acting U.S. Attorney, on August 5, 2020, in the Southern District of New York.",
    "The document indicates that the withheld records are considered exempt in their entirety, with any non-exempt information being 'inextricably intertwined' with information that could interfere with the prosecutions.",
    "Correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas are charged with conspiracy and making false records for failing to perform any inmate counts or rounds in the SHU from approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9 to 6:30 a.m. on August 10, 2019.",
    "Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in his cell at approximately 6:33 a.m. on August 10, 2019, after a night with no officer checks, despite a prior suicide attempt and a psychological directive that he have a cellmate.",
    "Noel and Thomas falsified count slips for five institutional counts (4 p.m., 10 p.m., 12 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m.) and Noel falsified over 75 entries for 30-minute rounds they did not perform.",
    "Video surveillance confirmed that no officer entered Epstein's tier from approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9 until 6:30 a.m. on August 10, and that Noel and Thomas were asleep or browsing the internet instead of working.",
    "The indictment is signed by United States Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman and charges violations of Title 18, U.S. Code, Sections 371 (conspiracy) and 1001(a)(3) (false records).",
    "Nicholas Tartaglione is charged with a conspiracy to distribute 5 kilograms or more of cocaine from 2015 to April 2016.",
    "Tartaglione is charged with the murders of four individuals—Martin Luna, Urbano Santiago, Miguel Luna, and Hector Gutierrez—in April 2016, while engaged in drug trafficking.",
    "The indictment details a kidnapping conspiracy where Tartaglione lured Martin Luna to the Likquid Lounge on April 11, 2016, leading to the confinement and subsequent deaths of all four victims.",
    "Multiple counts involve the use of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime, resulting in murder charges for the deaths of Santiago, Miguel Luna, and Gutierrez.",
    "The document is a superseding indictment, indicating it replaces or adds to a previous indictment in the case S4 16 Cr. 832 (KMK).",
    "Nicholas Tartaglione is charged with multiple counts of intentional killing and kidnapping resulting in death in furtherance of drug trafficking crimes.",
    "The victims named are Martin Luna, Urbano Santiago, Miguel Luna, and Hector Gutierrez.",
    "The crimes involved luring victims, holding them captive, transportation, and killing, with substantial planning and premeditation.",
    "The acts were committed in an especially heinous, cruel, and depraved manner involving torture and serious physical abuse.",
