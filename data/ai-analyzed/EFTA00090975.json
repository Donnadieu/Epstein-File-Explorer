    "The document is an internal SDNY email outlining the process for requesting federal forfeiture funds to cover large case expenses for the upcoming fiscal year (FY22).",
    "It references the 'Epstein/Maxwell' case explicitly in an attached document title ('_Large_Case_Related_Expenses_-_Epstem_Maxwell.docx'), indicating it was an active case with anticipated significant expenses requiring special funding.",
    "Guidance specifies that funding requests should only be made for cases where the estimated amount of forfeitable assets exceeds $1 million, justifying the expense as an investment to secure a larger forfeiture.",
    "Allowable expenses include payments to outside vendors for financial analysis, document review, forensic analysis, expert consultants, data hosting (specifically mentioning Relativity on PAE Labat), translation, and foreign travel.",
    "The email demonstrates the procedural and financial mechanisms within the DOJ for supporting complex, high-value prosecutions like the Epstein/Maxwell case."
