  "summary": "This is a court opinion and order by Judge Alison J. Nathan denying Ghislaine Maxwell's motion to suppress evidence obtained via a grand jury subpoena to the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (BSF). The evidence, including Maxwell's deposition transcripts from a prior civil defamation case, was covered by a protective order. The court rejects Maxwell's arguments that obtaining the evidence violated her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, her Fourth Amendment rights, or her due process rights, and denies her request for an evidentiary hearing.",

    "The government obtained Ghislaine Maxwell's deposition transcripts from a prior civil defamation case via a grand jury subpoena served on the opposing law firm, Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (BSF).",
    "The court ruled Maxwell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in documents produced in civil litigation, even under a protective order, and thus no Fourth Amendment violation occurred.",
    "The court ruled Maxwell's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was not violated because she voluntarily testified in the civil depositions and could have invoked the privilege but did not.",
    "The court rejected Maxwell's due process claim, finding she failed to make a substantial showing that the government deliberately misled the court or that the alleged omission was necessary to the judge's decision to modify the protective order.",
    "Much of the evidence obtained, including the bulk of Maxwell's deposition transcripts, has since been unsealed and made public by court order in the civil case."
