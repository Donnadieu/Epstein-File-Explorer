    "The government obtained Ghislaine Maxwell's deposition transcripts from a prior civil defamation case via a grand jury subpoena served on the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (BSF), after a court modified the case's protective order.",

    "The court found Maxwell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in documents produced in civil litigation, as protective orders are 'porous and ephemeral' and do not guarantee against use in subsequent criminal proceedings.",
    "Maxwell claimed the government misled Judge McMahon by not disclosing a 2016 meeting between BSF attorneys and an AUSA, but the court found no substantial showing of deliberate/reckless misrepresentation or that the omission was necessary to the judge's decision.",
    "The deposition transcripts Maxwell sought to suppress are the basis for perjury charges (counts five and six of the SI superseding indictment) against her in the criminal case."
