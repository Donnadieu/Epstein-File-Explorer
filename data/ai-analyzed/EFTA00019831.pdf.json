    "This is a standard proffer agreement, not a cooperation agreement, meaning the client provides information so the government can evaluate it for prosecutive decisions without guaranteeing any benefits.",
    "The agreement protects the client's statements from being used in the government's case-in-chief, but allows their use for cross-examination, rebuttal, or if the client commits perjury or becomes a fugitive.",
    "The agreement is dated January 14, 2019, which is after Jeffrey Epstein's 2008 conviction but before his 2019 arrest, suggesting it may relate to an associate or witness in the ongoing investigation.",
    "The client and their attorney are not named in the document, indicating a redacted or placeholder identity.",
    "The agreement explicitly states the government can use information from the proffer to obtain leads to other evidence that can be used against the client."
