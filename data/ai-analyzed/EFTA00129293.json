    "The post claims a person in a 'green dress military outfit' was in the back of the van, according to a tower guard.",
    "The poster suggests Epstein may have been 'switched out' and did not actually hang himself in his cell.",
    "The report was generated from records provided pursuant to a subpoena, indicating it was part of an official investigation.",
    "The post states that releases do not occur on weekends unless ordered by a judge, implying the van's arrival was irregular."
