    "The document is an email chain dated August 11-12, 2019, discussing Bureau of Prisons (BOP) suicide watch policy.",
    "It includes a forwarded paragraph that defines suicide watch as a 'short-term crisis intervention' with highly restrictive conditions not meant for long-term use.",
    "The email states the information was provided by an 'acting branch chief' and had not been reviewed or cleared by 'IPPA or Dir' (likely institutional or departmental authorities).",
    "The policy justification describes typical suicide watch conditions: a special cell, suicide smock, constant observation, 24-hour lights, and limited personal property.",
    "The assessment to end suicide watch is conducted by a doctoral-level psychologist, followed by ongoing monitoring and interventions."
