  "summary": "This is a court opinion and order by Judge Alison J. Nathan regarding the defense's motion to exclude the government's expert witness, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial. The court largely denies the motion, finding Dr. Rocchio's testimony on grooming and trauma in sexual abuse cases admissible under the Daubert standard, but excludes one specific opinion about 'grooming-by-proxy'.",

    "The court ruled that Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert on trauma and sexual abuse, is qualified and her testimony on grooming is largely admissible in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial.",
    "The court excluded one specific opinion from Dr. Rocchio: that the presence of a third party can facilitate grooming ('grooming-by-proxy'), finding it lacked sufficient support in the relevant literature.",
    "The court found Dr. Rocchio's testimony relevant to help the jury understand how minors can be coerced without physical force and to rebut anticipated defense impeachment strategies regarding victim behavior.",
    "The document confirms the government's theory that Maxwell both participated in abuse and conspired with Jeffrey Epstein, who groomed and abused minors."
