    "The interviewed lieutenant stated she was unaware of the email requirement that Epstein needed a cellmate after coming off suicide watch, and believed the information should have been communicated verbally to all staff.",
    "Staffing was critically low at MCC during this period, with correctional officers working 16+ hour days due to mandatory overtime and vacant posts.",
    "The lieutenant expressed strong professional opinion that Epstein should have been placed in the maximum-security unit (10 South) from the beginning due to his high-profile status and prior suicide attempt.",
    "There was confusion about the midnight count on August 10th because an inmate from SHU was being housed in R&D, leading to a count discrepancy that required correction.",
    "The lieutenant stated there was no verification process to ensure COs actually conducted counts and rounds beyond taking their word, and supervisors were not required to visually verify inmate counts."
