  "keyFacts": [
    "In September 2020, a client of attorney Jill Greenfield was willing to speak with US Attorneys from the SDNY about the Epstein investigation.",
    "The proposed communication was to involve the client asking prosecutors 'how you would manage this,' indicating she had concerns or conditions.",
    "Logistical planning was complicated by COVID-19, as government employee travel was potentially prohibited, making a videoconference the likely format.",
    "The prosecutors were seeking internal approvals for the meeting and needed to propose specific dates to move the approval process forward.",
    "The email chain shows an active investigative dialogue between a witness's counsel and the prosecution team years after Epstein's arrest and death."
