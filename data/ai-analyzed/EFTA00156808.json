  "summary": "This is a clinical research article from the European Journal of Psychotraumatology titled 'Predictors of delayed disclosure of rape in female adolescents and young adults.' It presents a study of 321 female rape victims aged 12-25 in the Netherlands, analyzing factors associated with delayed disclosure (more than one week post-rape). The study finds that younger age (12-17), penetration during assault, and closeness to the assailant are significant predictors of delayed disclosure, which in turn reduces the likelihood of using medical services or reporting to police. This document is an academic research article titled 'Predictors of delayed disclosure of rape' published in the European Journal of Psychotraumatology. It presents a study analyzing factors associated with delayed disclosure of rape among adolescents and young adults (ages 12-25) in the Netherlands, finding that younger age, penetration, and closeness to the assailant predict delayed disclosure. The study notes delayed disclosers are less likely to use medical services or report to police. This document appears to be a bibliography or reference list from an academic paper or report, likely related to research on sexual assault, disclosure patterns, trauma, and mental health outcomes. It contains no direct information about the Epstein case, individuals involved, or specific events.",

    "The study analyzed 321 female adolescent and young adult (12-25 years) rape victims in the Netherlands, finding 59% disclosed within one week (early disclosers).",
    "Key predictors for delayed disclosure (more than one week) were: age 12-17 years (OR 2.05), penetration during assault (OR 2.36), and closeness to the assailant (OR 2.64).",
    "Delayed disclosers were significantly less likely to use medical services (15.9% vs 30.3%) or report to the police (14.6% vs 34.3%) compared to early disclosers.",
    "The study found no significant differences in psychological functioning (PTSD, depression, general psychopathology) between early and delayed disclosers after controlling for time since trauma.",
    "The research highlights the need for targeted interventions to encourage early disclosure among rape victims to improve access to health and justice services.",
    "The study found three key predictors of delayed disclosure (>1 week) of rape: victim age 12-17 years, penetration during assault, and the assailant being a close person (e.g., boyfriend, friend, family member).",
    "Delayed disclosers were significantly less likely to use medical services or report to the police compared to early disclosers, impacting public health and safety.",
    "Most adolescent victims disclosed first to peers rather than parents, and peer-to-peer victimization was common in the sample.",
    "The research sample consisted of 316 Dutch adolescents and young adults (12-25 years) seeking mental health care after a single rape event, with no prior chronic childhood sexual abuse for 85%.",
    "The study discusses limitations including use of a clinical sample with high psychological distress (ceiling effect) and results not generalizable to victims who never disclose.",
    "The text is exclusively a list of academic citations and references.",
    "All content pertains to general research on sexual assault, disclosure, trauma, and mental health.",
    "No named individuals, events, or locations specific to the Epstein case are present.",
    "The document appears to be a supporting bibliography, not a primary case document.",
    "The file name and page numbers suggest it is part of a larger document set, but this chunk contains no case-specific data."
