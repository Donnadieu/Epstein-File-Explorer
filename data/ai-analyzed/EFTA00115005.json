    "The witness expressed that communication and training at MCC were poor, with staff often not properly trained and following incorrect practices they observed from others.",
    "The witness believed Epstein took his own life, had no knowledge of anyone assisting him or causing his death, and did not believe cameras were intentionally knocked offline."
