    "A critical RAID storage failure occurred at the MCC New York facility on or around August 8, 2019, which is the same facility where Jeffrey Epstein was held and died.",
    "The failed system was a NICE Vision Pro Unit NVR, a video recording system, suggesting potential loss of surveillance footage.",
    "Attempts to rebuild the RAID array on August 10, 2019, corrupted the video database, resulting in permanent data loss.",
    "The timing of this hardware failure (August 2019) coincides closely with Epstein's death on August 10, 2019, raising questions about evidence preservation."
