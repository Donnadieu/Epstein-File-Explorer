  "summary": "This is the prepared testimony of David E. Patton, Executive Director of the Federal Defenders of New York, before a House Judiciary subcommittee oversight hearing on the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the implementation of the First Step Act. The testimony criticizes the BOP's history of mismanagement, citing the 2019 fire and power outage crisis at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn and the suicide of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan as examples of systemic failures. It raises concerns about the BOP's ability to faithfully implement the First Step Act, particularly regarding programming, the PATTERN risk assessment tool, and the closure of Residential Reentry Centers. A letter from the Federal Public Defender for the Western District of Washington to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, detailing systemic Bureau practices that are causing the closure of reentry centers and reducing pre-release time for federal inmates, in contravention of Congressional mandates like the Second Chance Act and First Step Act. The letter urges immediate corrective action. This document contains a letter from Federal Public Defender Thomas W. Hillier II to the Acting Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Thomas R. Kane, providing formal comment on proposed regulations implementing the Second Chance Act's pre-release community confinement provisions. The letter argues the BOP's proposed regulation fails to comply with congressional mandates, should include a presumption of maximum community corrections, and should reject an informal six-month limitation rule. An attachment lists Residential Reentry Center contracts expiring or not being renewed. This document is a compilation of news articles from Reuters and CNN (dated 2017-2019) and a U.S. Bureau of Prisons internal memorandum (dated October 10, 2017) regarding the Trump administration's decision to reduce funding and cancel contracts for 16 federal prisoner halfway houses (Residential Reentry Centers). It details the policy's impact, reactions from judges, advocates, and contractors, and includes a related 2019 solicitation for RRC services in Oklahoma. This document is the Bureau of Prisons' 2018 annual report to Congress on the use of community corrections facilities (Residential Reentry Centers and home confinement), as required by the Second Chance Act. It provides statistical data from April 2017 through March 2018, detailing inmate eligibility, placement rates, lengths of stay, and program goals.",

  "keyFacts": [
    "The testimony details a severe week-long crisis at the MDC Brooklyn in January 2019 where inmates were locked in dark, freezing cells without adequate medical care or communication after a fire knocked out power.",
    "Jeffrey Epstein's suicide at the MCC is cited as an example of the systemic failures and lack of accountability within the BOP.",
    "The testimony raises major concerns about the BOP's implementation of the First Step Act, particularly the lack of programming, the opaque and potentially racially biased PATTERN risk assessment tool, and the closure of Residential Reentry Centers.",
    "Warden Herman Quay of the MDC was accused of repeatedly lying about conditions during the crisis and was later promoted.",
    "The attached exhibits include a detailed technical critique of the PATTERN tool's development and a letter documenting the closure of reentry centers, showing coordinated advocacy by federal defenders.",
    "The Bureau of Prisons is systematically reducing reentry center capacity through non-renewal of contracts, soliciting contracts for fewer beds with fewer guaranteed payments, and decreasing the length of pre-release stays for inmates.",
    "These practices contradict Congressional mandates in the Second Chance Act (which authorized up to one year of pre-release community placement) and threaten the implementation of the newer First Step Act.",
    "Specific reentry centers have closed or are in danger of closing in multiple states including Hawaii, Maine, North Carolina, California, Oklahoma, and Oregon, often after being encouraged by the BOP to expand capacity just a few years earlier.",
    "The average length of placement in reentry centers decreased by almost 20% from April-June 2017 to January-March 2018, from 146 days to 119 days on average.",
    "The letter urges the BOP Director to issue emergency directives to halt further bed reductions, consult with judiciary chiefs, and rescind policies restricting pre-release time to less than Congress authorized.",
    "The Federal Public Defender argues the BOP's proposed regulation violates the Second Chance Act by failing to issue evidence-based rules on the optimal duration of pre-release community corrections.",
    "The letter contends the BOP maintains an informal 'six-month rule' for community confinement that lacks empirical support and nullifies the Act's intent to double available time to twelve months.",
    "The Defender proposes a regulation that presumes maximum community corrections (up to 12 months) to promote successful reentry and save taxpayer money, citing potential annual savings of hundreds of millions of dollars.",
    "An attachment lists 16 Residential Reentry Center (RRC) contracts across the country that are expiring or not having their option years renewed, indicating a reduction in halfway house capacity.",
    "A referenced Reuters article from 2017 reports the Trump administration reduced support for prisoner halfway houses, severing contracts and potentially extending inmates' time in prison.",
    "The Federal Bureau of Prisons, under the Trump administration, discontinued 16 contracts with Residential Reentry Centers (halfway houses) in 2017, affecting 146 beds, citing underutilization and fiscal constraints.",
    "The policy shift was criticized by federal judges, criminal justice reform advocates, and bipartisan senators who argued it would harm prisoner re-entry and community safety.",
    "A Bureau of Prisons internal memorandum dated October 10, 2017, formally outlined the measures, including reducing the average length of stay in RRCs from 145 days to about 120-125 days.",
    "The document includes a 2019 solicitation for new RRC and Home Confinement services in Oklahoma, indicating ongoing procurement for these services despite the earlier cuts.",
    "Key figures involved include Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who advocated for tougher sentencing, and BOP Director Mark Inch, who implemented the contract cancellations shortly after his appointment.",
    "From April 2017 to March 2018, 34,738 federal inmates were eligible for transfer to Residential Reentry Centers (RRCs) or home confinement; 72% (25,000) were actually transferred.",
    "The average expected length of stay in an RRC for inmates releasing during this period was 136.8 days, a decrease from the previous fiscal year.",
    "A primary reason for inmate ineligibility for community confinement was release to a detainer (22,304 cases), the vast majority lodged by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on non-U.S. citizens.",
    "The Bureau of Prisons was soliciting contracts for Day Reporting Centers as a non-residential alternative to traditional RRCs, with one operational in Memphis and another planned for Sacramento.",
    "The report is a statutory requirement under the Second Chance Act of 2007, demonstrating congressional oversight of BOP reentry programs."
