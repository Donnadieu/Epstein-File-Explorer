    "The document critiques defense expert Dr. Dietz's conclusion that sexual assault survivors would avoid reminders of the assault, arguing it ignores literature on ongoing abusive relationships and coercive control.",
    "It references betrayal trauma literature (Dr. Jennifer Freyd) explaining how victims can maintain relationships with perpetrators as an adaptive mechanism.",
    "The notes discuss the 'Bennett article' on grooming, noting it lacks an error rate but provides a good conceptual review, though its Daubert opinion was a 'side comment'.",
    "Legal materials referenced include a defense motion to exclude Rocchio's testimony, government opposition, and defense expert notices for Dietz and Loftus, indicating active Daubert challenges.",
    "The document challenges the idea that PTSD-related avoidance precludes victims from having ongoing contact with perpetrators, citing reasons like minimization, denial, and coercive control."
