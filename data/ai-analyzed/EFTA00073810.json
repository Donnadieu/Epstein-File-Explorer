  "summary": "This is a letter from Jeffrey Epstein's defense attorney, Marc Fernich, to Judge Richard M. Berman, supplementing Epstein's request for bail. The letter argues against the government's position that Epstein's wealth creates an irrebuttable presumption for detention, proposes conditions for release including a forensic accounting, and addresses various government concerns such as his finances, domestic ties, New Mexico registration, and an expired Austrian passport.",
