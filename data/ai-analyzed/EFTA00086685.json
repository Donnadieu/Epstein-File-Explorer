    "The court grants the government's application to modify a 2016 protective order from Giuffre v. Maxwell, allowing the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP to comply with a grand jury subpoena as part of a federal sex trafficking investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and others.",
    "The government's investigation, commenced in late 2018, is into violations of federal sex trafficking and enticement statutes (18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 1594(c), 2422(b)).",
    "Judge McMahon finds that Ghislaine Maxwell's reliance on the protective order to shield materials from a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, and that the government has demonstrated 'extraordinary circumstances' warranting modification, including significant public interest and the need for grand jury secrecy.",
    "The decision references the controversial 2007 plea deal for Epstein, allegations of misconduct by government officials (including a then-U.S. Attorney now in the President's Cabinet), and the Miami Herald's 2018 exposé which renewed public interest.",
    "Third parties, including Alan Dershowitz, Michael Cernovich, and the Miami Herald, had previously sought to unseal the Giuffre v. Maxwell record, but were denied by Judge Sweet; a consolidated appeal on those unsealing motions is pending before the Second Circuit."
