    "The court found that any reliance by Maxwell on the protective order to shield materials from a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, given the order's language permitting court-ordered disclosure.",
    "The government demonstrated 'extraordinary circumstances' warranting modification, citing the serious nature of the crimes, significant public interest, and the need for grand jury secrecy.",
    "The decision highlights the tension between confidentiality in civil litigation and the needs of criminal investigations, applying the Second Circuit's Martindell standard."
