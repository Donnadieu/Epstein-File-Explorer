    "Dr. Lisa Rocchio is a licensed psychologist specializing in traumatic stress and the effects of childhood sexual abuse, with experience evaluating and treating thousands of such individuals.",
    "The document defines 'grooming' as a series of behaviors used to target, isolate, and build attachment and trust with a child while gradually introducing sexualized behaviors, noting that third parties can sometimes facilitate this process.",
    "It states that the vast majority of victims of child sexual abuse do not disclose the abuse until adulthood, with teenagers being most at risk for delayed disclosure.",
    "The testimony preparation clarifies that scientific research supports that a minor who has been previously sexually abused is at higher risk of being abused again, but consensual sexual activity as a minor does not scientifically relate to susceptibility to grooming by an adult."
