  "summary": "This is a legal opinion by David Perry QC, commissioned by Ghislaine Maxwell's UK solicitors (Peters and Peters), analyzing UK extradition law as it applies to a hypothetical scenario where Maxwell flees to the UK in breach of US bail. The opinion concludes it is extremely unlikely she would be granted bail in the UK and highly unlikely she could successfully resist extradition, with the process taking 1-3 months if she consents. The document includes Maxwell's signed waiver of extradition rights.",
