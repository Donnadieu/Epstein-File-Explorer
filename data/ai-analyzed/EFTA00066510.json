  "summary": "This is a 2021 opinion and order by Judge Alison J. Nathan denying Ghislaine Maxwell's motion to suppress evidence obtained via a grand jury subpoena to the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (BSF). Maxwell argued the subpoena violated her Fifth and Fourth Amendment rights and due process because the documents were under a protective order from prior civil litigation. The court rejects all arguments, finding no constitutional violation and no basis for suppression or an evidentiary hearing.",

    "The government obtained Ghislaine Maxwell's deposition transcripts from her prior civil defamation case via a grand jury subpoena to the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, which had represented Virginia Giuffre.",
    "Maxwell argued the subpoena violated her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Fourth Amendment rights, and due process because the documents were under a protective order, but the court rejected all arguments.",
    "The court found Maxwell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in documents shared widely in civil litigation and that the protective order provided no guarantee against use in a criminal case.",
    "Maxwell claimed the government misled Judge McMahon by not disclosing a 2016 meeting with BSF attorneys, but the court found no deliberate misrepresentation and that the omission was not material to the modification order.",
    "The deposition transcripts are central to perjury charges (counts five and six of the superseding indictment) against Maxwell for false statements made under oath."
