The opinion details the proposed bail package and the court's reasons for rejecting it.",

    "Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted on charges of conspiracy to entice minors to travel for illegal sex acts, transportation of minors for illegal sex acts, and perjury.",
    "The court found Maxwell a clear flight risk due to the charges' seriousness, strong government evidence, her substantial financial resources, multiple foreign citizenships (including French citizenship which complicates extradition), and lack of candor about her finances.",
    "Maxwell proposed a $28.5 million bail package including home confinement with GPS monitoring and private security guards, which the court rejected, citing her capacity to evade detection and legal precedent against wealth-based release.",
    "The court noted the government's case relies on multiple corroborating witnesses who will provide detailed accounts of Maxwell's alleged role, along with flight records and other evidence.",
    "Despite alarming COVID-19 rates at the Metropolitan Detention Center, the court ruled the pandemic was not a basis for release given the flight risk determination."
