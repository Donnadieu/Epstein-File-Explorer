    "Approximately 2,700 pages of Bureau of Prisons documents related to Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration and suicide were scheduled for release on July 2, 2021.",
    "The documents were previously withheld due to the criminal prosecution of guards Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, which was resolved via deferred prosecution agreements in May 2021.",
    "The documents include internal BOP memoranda, Epstein's psychological records, the autopsy report, and emails showing institutional failures and confusion on the day of Epstein's death.",
    "A notable item among the documents is a photograph of a defaced sign in the Special Housing Unit that stated rounds on Epstein were 'mandatory, signed \"God,\"' which had been altered to include a question mark.",
    "The report states the documents reveal numerous failures that allowed Epstein the opportunity to kill himself, including failure to reassign a cellmate, perform counts or rounds, and ensure adequate staffing."
