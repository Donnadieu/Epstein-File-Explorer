    "Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team issued a subpoena to the United States to compel production of all documents from the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (EVCP), including claim forms, communications, payments, and releases.",
    "The EVCP is a voluntary, independent program funded by Jeffrey Epstein's estate to compensate victims of his sexual abuse, administered by an independent administrator with final authority over claims.",
    "The program protocol explicitly states that individuals who allegedly assisted Epstein in procuring victims may still be eligible for compensation if they acted under duress due to their own abuse by Epstein.",
    "The subpoena seeks to obtain material that could be used in Maxwell's criminal defense, specifically targeting information about accusers and their interactions with the compensation program.",
    "The EVCP protocol emphasizes claimant confidentiality but notes that claimants are not bound by any rules of confidentiality and are free to discuss their allegations with law enforcement or anyone else."
