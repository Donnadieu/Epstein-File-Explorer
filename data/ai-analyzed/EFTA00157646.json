  "summary": "This is a supplemental ex parte declaration by an FBI Special Agent in support of the government's response to a motion to quash grand jury subpoenas in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. The agent details new information from an interview with a 14-year-old victim (Jane Doe) who was recruited to provide massages and engage in sexual acts with Epstein, and describes evidence of nude photography of the minor, arguing the subpoenaed computers likely contain evidence of solicitation of minors and child pornography.",
