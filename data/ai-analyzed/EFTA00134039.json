It includes Comcast phone records for a specific number from July-August 2019, and credit reports from Equifax and Experian for an individual, all provided as part of the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. This document is a response from Experian to a grand jury subpoena issued by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, dated August 30, 2019.

The document includes the subpoena, a rider specifying the requested individuals, a declaration of custodian of records form, and extensive Experian credit report documentation and glossaries.",
