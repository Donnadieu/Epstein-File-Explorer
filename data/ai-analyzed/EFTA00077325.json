  "summary": "This is a formal application by defense attorneys Foy & Sepowitz LLC to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, requesting a deferred prosecution agreement for their client Tova Noel. Noel, a former correctional officer at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), was indicted for falsifying records related to inmate counts and rounds on the night of Jeffrey Epstein's death. The application argues for leniency based on Noel's background, systemic failures at MCC, inadequate training, and the collateral consequences of prosecution.",

    "Tova Noel, a correctional officer at MCC, was indicted on six counts for conspiring to falsely certify inmate counts and rounds, specifically related to the shift when Jeffrey Epstein died.",
    "The defense argues systemic failures at MCC, including severe understaffing, forced overtime ('mandations'), inadequate training for the SHU, and a toxic work environment with inmate drug use, contributed to the alleged misconduct.",
    "Noel had no prior criminal record, served honorably in the Army National Guard, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2009. She was a relatively inexperienced officer with less than a year of active duty at the time of the incident.",
    "The application cites precedent cases (U.S. v. Hernandez and U.S. v. William Marshall) where similar charges against correctional officers resulted in probation, dismissal, or non-prosecution agreements, arguing for similar leniency.",
    "The document reveals that a lieutenant at MCC instructed Noel to sign documents falsely confirming she had received required SHU training that she never actually received, to help the facility pass a program review."
