    "Maxwell was allegedly subjected to inadequate nutrition, losing a significant amount of weight, being denied full meals, and going over 20 hours without food on one occasion; the MDC removed the scale from her area.",
    "The defense requested government intervention to improve conditions, including providing a proper desk, reorienting her computer, improving food, curtailing frequent body scans, and ensuring delivery of mail and approved commissary items.",
    "The letter references a protective order requiring Maxwell to review 'Highly Confidential' documents only in the presence of defense counsel and law enforcement, and requests a time be set for such a review."
