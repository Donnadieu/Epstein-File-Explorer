  "summary": "This is a legal filing by attorneys for two victims (Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2) in response to the U.S. Government's notice claiming no need for an evidentiary hearing regarding the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA). The document argues the Government violated the victims' rights by entering into a confidential Non-Prosecution Agreement with Jeffrey Epstein in September 2007 without conferring with them, and requests the court to order production of the agreement and an FBI interview report. This is a legal filing by attorneys for Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2, arguing the U.S. Government violated their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) by negotiating a non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein without conferring with them. The filing requests the court to order the government to produce the full non-prosecution agreement and an FBI interview report of Jane Doe #1, and to schedule a hearing on remedies for the rights violations.",

    "The U.S. Attorney's Office entered into a confidential Non-Prosecution Agreement with Jeffrey Epstein in September 2007, which contained an 'express confidentiality provision' preventing disclosure to victims.",
    "The agreement blocked federal prosecution of Epstein for sex crimes against minors, contingent on a state conviction requiring sex offender registration, and envisioned victims pursuing civil rights actions.",
    "FBI agents met with victim Jane Doe #1 in October 2007 but did not disclose the existence of the finalized agreement, leading her to believe the federal investigation was ongoing.",
    "The Government sent letters to victims in January 2008 stating the case was 'currently under investigation,' despite the agreement being signed months earlier.",
    "The victims' attorneys first learned of the Non-Prosecution Agreement on or after July 9, 2008, nearly ten months after it was finalized, when the Government filed a responsive pleading.",
    "The filing argues the U.S. Government violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) by negotiating a non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein without conferring with the victims, Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2.",
    "The victims' attorneys request the court to order the government to produce the full, secret non-prosecution agreement and any addenda, which is central to the litigation.",
    "The filing reveals the government has an FBI report of an interview with Jane Doe #1 from October 26, 2007, but has declined to provide it to her, which the motion seeks to compel.",
    "The victims seek a judicial declaration that their rights were violated, an apology from the government, and a hearing to determine the appropriate remedy, but are not seeking to invalidate the non-prosecution agreement.",
    "The document is a formal court filing (Document 19) in Case No. 9:08-cv-80736-KAM, entered on the docket on August 1, 2008."
