    "Ghislaine Maxwell was housed in protective custody at MDC with sole access to a room for computer/phone use ~13 hours/day, while Justin Rivera was in general population at MCC sharing VTC room with ~80 other inmates.",
    "Maxwell's case had 'multiple times more discovery' than Rivera's, justifying greater electronic access needs.",
    "The MCC began leaving a laptop with Rivera all day for charging only at night, effectively matching Maxwell's electronic discovery access hours.",
    "Judge Engelmayer described the disparity in access as 'strikingly different' with 'terrible' optics, and defense counsel suggested differential treatment based on race, gender, and class.",
    "The US Attorney's Office attributed disparities to specific housing situations, facility resources, and case-specific requests from lawyers, not discriminatory intent."
