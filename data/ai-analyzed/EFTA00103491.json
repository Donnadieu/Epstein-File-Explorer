  "summary": "This document is a Touhy request letter from the law firm Kaplan Hecker & Fink LLP to U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman, dated February 25, 2020, on behalf of a plaintiff known as Jane Doe. The letter demands records from the DOJ related to the criminal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein to support Doe's civil lawsuit against his estate. The document includes the complaint from the civil case (Doe v. Indyke et al.), which details allegations that Epstein repeatedly sexually abused Jane Doe from around 2002 to 2005, starting when she was 14 years old. This is a civil complaint filed by Jane Doe against the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein, alleging sexual assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. It details a pattern of abuse over three years, the facilitation by Epstein's employees, and the impact on the victim's life. It also references Epstein's 2019 indictment, death, and will.",
