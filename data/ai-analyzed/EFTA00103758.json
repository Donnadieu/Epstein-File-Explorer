  "summary": "This is a supplemental pretrial motion memorandum filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team in the Southern District of New York. The motion argues that the S2 Superseding Indictment should be dismissed or limited because the charges (Counts One, Three, Five, and Six) are barred by the 2007 Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) with Jeffrey Epstein, violate double jeopardy, are time-barred, and are multiplicitous. It focuses heavily on the allegations of 'Accuser-4' (Minor Victim-4), arguing her recent accusations against Maxwell are inconsistent with her 2007-2008 statements to the Florida investigation which implicated Sarah Kellen, not Maxwell.",

    "The defense contends that prosecuting Maxwell on Counts Five and Six constitutes double jeopardy because Epstein was already punished for those offenses via the NPA (state guilty plea, sex offender registration, victim settlements).",
    "The motion requests the court to order the government to produce Accuser-4's prior statements to the FBI as exculpatory Brady material, arguing the omission of Maxwell is favorable to the defense."
