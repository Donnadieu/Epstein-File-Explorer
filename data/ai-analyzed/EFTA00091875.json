  "summary": "This is a legal memorandum filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team, requesting the court to sever Counts Five and Six (perjury counts) from Counts One through Four (Mann Act counts) of the superseding indictment. The defense argues improper joinder and that a joint trial would cause substantial prejudice by introducing allegations from a different time period and complicating the trial with issues from a civil defamation case.",

    "The defense motion argues that perjury counts from 2016 depositions are improperly joined with sex trafficking counts from 1994-1997, as they involve different time periods, victims, and alleged conduct.",
    "The perjury counts stem from a civil defamation case where the plaintiff (whose name is redacted) made allegations about abuse occurring from 1999-2002, a period for which Maxwell was never criminally charged.",
    "The defense claims joining the counts would prejudice Maxwell by allowing the jury to hear allegations of uncharged conduct from 1999-2002, risking a conviction based on improper propensity inference.",
    "The motion states the Palm Beach Police Department investigation into Epstein's activities in the early-mid 2000s found no evidence against Maxwell from over 30 interviewed alleged victims.",
    "The defense contends a joint trial would be inefficient and confusing, requiring the jury to re-litigate a complex civil defamation case with numerous unresolved motions and evidentiary issues."
