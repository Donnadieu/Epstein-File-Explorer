    "Judge Alison J. Nathan granted the government's motion to preclude defense expert Bennett Gershman from testifying in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial.",
    "The court excluded Gershman's testimony on three grounds: it was irrelevant to Maxwell's guilt, its prejudicial effect outweighed any probative value under Rule 403, and the defense's disclosure failed to satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16.",
    "The court had previously ruled that evidence attacking the thoroughness of the government's investigation was irrelevant, and found Gershman's planned topics (investigation, witness prep, media contact) fell under that prohibition.",
    "The defense's notice for Gershman only listed general topics of testimony without summarizing his actual opinions or their bases, which was insufficient under Rule 16.",
    "The document references the defense's theory that witnesses had motives for implicating Maxwell after Jeffrey Epstein's death, which the court stated could be a permissible line of cross-examination for bias."
