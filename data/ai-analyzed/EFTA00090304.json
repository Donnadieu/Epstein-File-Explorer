    "Ghislaine Maxwell's legal team filed complaints about her being subjected to 'repeated, inappropriate touching' of her breasts during daily pat-down searches while in custody.",
    "The defense alleged that Maxwell was ordered to clean a toilet bare-handed at 6:40 AM, outside of prescribed sanitation hours for pretrial inmates, which they viewed as a punitive act.",
    "Maxwell experienced delays in appearing for her scheduled 12:30 PM video court conferences, which her legal team suggested could be retribution for prior complaints.",
    "The defense argued that the frequency and manner of searches, including guards running fingers through her hair near her face, unnecessarily increased Maxwell's risk of COVID-19 exposure.",
    "A BOP official defended the institution's actions, stating searches complied with policy and that schedule deviations were due to institutional emergencies."
