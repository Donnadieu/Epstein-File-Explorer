    "The document is a law enforcement email analyzing Jeffrey Epstein's travel from October 2016 to November 2018, showing frequent private flights between New Jersey/New York and Paris.",
    "It notes potential missed recordings for back-to-back outbound flights on specific dates (e.g., Feb 16-17, 2017) and clarifies that 'vehicle' entries from the USVI are domestic, not international, crossings.",
    "The analysis raises the point that if Epstein traveled from the USVI to foreign territories like the British Virgin Islands, he would have had to report to CBP as a registered sex offender.",
    "Five private aircraft tail numbers are associated with Epstein's travel: N212JE, N120JE, N415LM, N331JE, and N90JE.",
    "The correspondence is marked as Law Enforcement Sensitive and outlines procedures for authenticating the records for court use, as the sender is not authorized to testify as a CBP custodian."
