    "The document defends the scientific validity of research on grooming and sexual abuse, citing a 2014 article by Bennet and O'Donohue that establishes grooming as a well-studied concept with a consistent body of literature.",
    "It argues that expertise in traumatic stress and interpersonal violence inherently involves understanding both victim experiences and offender behaviors, countering defense claims that Dr. Rocchio's work is solely based on presuming patient truthfulness.",
    "The text discusses 'betrayal trauma' and 'coercive control' as established scientific concepts, explaining how relational dynamics can lead to delayed disclosure by victims, referencing researchers like Jennifer Fried and Mary Koss.",
    "It notes that the concept of 'grooming by proxy' is not recognized as a scientifically valid term, but argues the literature on pimps, sex traffickers, and cult recruiters studies similar behaviors of procuring victims for third parties."
