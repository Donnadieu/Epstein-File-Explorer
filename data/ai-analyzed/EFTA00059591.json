    "Lieutenant Grijalva clarifies that 'pre-remove' and 'WAB' are essentially the same procedure, indicating an inmate is leaving the building and most likely not returning.",
    "The document reveals prior OIG interviews with Lt. Grijalva on August 19, 2019, and July 14, 2021, indicating a prolonged investigation.",
    "The interview is conducted under oath and follows a formal voluntary interview procedure with specific DOJ OIG warnings and assurances.",
    "Efrain Reyes was transferred out of the MCC SHU on August 9, 2019, and his status was listed as WAB (With All Belongings), indicating he was not returning.",
    "Jeffrey Epstein was not assigned a new cellmate after Reyes left, despite the interviewing officer stating he told Epstein he would get a new 'bunkie.'",
    "The officer being interviewed was the OIC (Officer in Charge) in the SHU on the morning of August 9, 2019, and was responsible for inmate movements and notifications.",
    "A separate incident involving inmate Fernandez occurred in the SHU visiting room on the same day, where he attempted to grab contraband from a visitor.",
    "The interview reveals confusion and lack of clear responsibility for notifying control about inmate movements and updating counts, contributing to procedural failures."
