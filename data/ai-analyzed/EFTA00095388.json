  "summary": "This is a transcript of a bail hearing in the Southern District of New York for Jeffrey Epstein, who is charged with conspiracy to commit sex trafficking and sex trafficking of minors. The government argues for pretrial detention based on extreme flight risk and danger to the community, citing his vast wealth, foreign passport, and alleged witness tampering. The defense argues for release under strict conditions, citing his compliance with prior legal obligations and the need to prepare his defense. Judge Richard M. Berman presides and indicates he will rule on July 18, 2019.",
