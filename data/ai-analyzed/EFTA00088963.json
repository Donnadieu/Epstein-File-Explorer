    "The document calculates a sentencing guidelines range of 41 to 51 months' imprisonment for a defendant charged with obstructing the investigation into Epstein's sex trafficking of minors.",
    "The underlying offense involved sex trafficking of minors with more than five minor victims, leading to a high base offense level.",
    "The defendant received a 3-level reduction for being considered a 'minor participant' in the criminal activity, significantly lowering the sentencing range.",
    "The prosecutor explicitly states the defendant was 'very significantly less culpable than Epstein'.",
    "The calculation assumes the defendant will accept responsibility and plead guilty, allowing for further sentence reductions."
