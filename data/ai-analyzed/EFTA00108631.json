  "summary": "This is an FBI administrative request for $50,000 in 'show money' to be used in an undercover operation targeting Alfredo Rodriguez. Rodriguez, who was previously interviewed by the FBI in 2007, is refusing to comply with a federal subpoena for documents related to a child sex solicitation case unless he is paid $50,000. The plan is to have an undercover agent meet with Rodriguez, show the money, obtain the documents, and then arrest him for obstruction of justice.",
