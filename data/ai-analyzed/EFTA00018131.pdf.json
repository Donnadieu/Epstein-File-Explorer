    "The investigation uncovered potential obstruction of justice, with reports that all institutional count slips requested prior to August 10 were 'missing' and that an inmate witnessed large-scale document shredding on August 15 and 16.",
    "The memorandum seeks approval to interview a cooperating inmate witness without his attorney present, arguing the inmate is not represented concerning his status as a witness and questions will be limited to the Epstein investigation."
