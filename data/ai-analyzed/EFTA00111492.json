    "The interview is part of the DOJ OIG investigation into the death of Jeffrey Epstein and the surrounding circumstances.",
    "The witness (M) was a Plumbing Worker Supervisor at MCC in August 2019 and occasionally acted for the Facilities Manager.",
    "M states he was not informed that security cameras were not working on August 9-10, 2019, and believes he would have remembered such an important issue.",
    "M states that if the com tech knew cameras were offline and left without fixing them or notifying management, that was not an acceptable course of action.",
    "M's understanding of Epstein's death is that officers did not do rounds and Epstein hung himself, and that having a cellmate or being on suicide watch might have prevented it."
