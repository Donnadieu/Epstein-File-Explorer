  "keyFacts": [
    "The government had produced over 165,000 pages of discovery to Maxwell's defense within two weeks of the protective order being entered.",
    "Maxwell's defense requested the court order the government to disclose the names of certain witnesses (victims referenced in the indictment) 11 months prior to trial, which the government strongly opposed.",
    "The government expressed concern that Maxwell's counsel had referenced receiving sealed discovery materials from the criminal case in a public filing in a separate civil case (Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell).",
    "The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) initially planned to give Maxwell 3 hours daily access to discovery but, due to the volume, increased it to access from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. daily.",
    "The government argued Maxwell's housing assignment in the MDC (not in general population) was an appropriate, individualized assessment by BOP for safety and security reasons."
