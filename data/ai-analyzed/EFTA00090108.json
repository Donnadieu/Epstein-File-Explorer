    "Ghislaine Maxwell is on an enhanced security schedule at MDC, resulting in flashlight checks of her cell every 15 minutes, more frequently than standard inmates.",
    "The enhanced security is due to the nature of the charges, the high-profile nature of the case, and Maxwell's own expressed safety concerns about being housed in the general population.",
    "MDC considers eye masks contraband and will not provide one to Maxwell, though she is permitted to use non-contraband items to cover her eyes.",
    "Maxwell is housed alone in a cell, a decision based in part on her safety concerns, as an alternative to housing her in the Special Housing Unit (SHU)."
