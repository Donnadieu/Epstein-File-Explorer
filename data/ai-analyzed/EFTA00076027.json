    "The document is an email chain from July 2019 discussing draft FBI remarks on the Epstein case.",
    "A factual correction is noted: the period 2002-2005 is four years, not three.",
    "A significant edit is suggested regarding victim terminology: it is noted there is no allegation victims 'were made to give' massages; a more accurate phrasing would be 'who gave Epstein massages'.",
    "A suggestion is made to use 'underage girls' instead of 'child' for consistency, as 'child' may imply pre-puberty.",
    "The email indicates coordination between the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI on public statements regarding the case."
