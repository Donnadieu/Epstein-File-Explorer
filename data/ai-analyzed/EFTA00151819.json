    "The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) were actively coordinating victim notification procedures in late June 2019, anticipating Jeffrey Epstein's arrest.",
    "A list of 31 identified victims existed, but most lacked contact information, and some had declined interviews or were advised by attorneys not to discuss the case.",
    "The urgency stressed was to have all victim information entered into the Victim Notification System (VNS) so victims could be notified of their rights immediately upon arrest and charging.",
    "The plan included a press release and an 800 number for victims to self-identify after the arrest.",
    "Email correspondents' names are partially redacted, but the chain shows coordination between FBI Victim Services and the SDNY."
