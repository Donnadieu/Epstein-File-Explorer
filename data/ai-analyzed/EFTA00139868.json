    "In July 2019, while incarcerated, Jeffrey Epstein received a letter from mathematician Jonathan Farley proposing Epstein donate $5 million to Morgan State University to create 'The Jeffrey Epstein Chair for the Promotion of Women in Mathematics'.",
    "Farley suggested such a donation would show the world Epstein was not a pariah and might help him avoid a conviction like Bill Cosby's, and would generate support in the black community.",
    "An alternative proposal was for Epstein to fund a £1.5 million lectureship in Pure Mathematics at Lincoln College, Oxford, with Farley suggesting he could take the position and become a public advocate for Epstein as an Oxford don.",
    "The letter references past contact, including a phone call from Epstein to Farley in August 2017 and a Skype call in December 2017 that included Farley's Ph.D. student Zeinab Bandpey.",
    "Farley explicitly frames the proposed donations as a 'lifesaver' for Epstein and a way to generate positive media coverage and public support for him."
