    "The government is seeking clarification from the court on the boundaries of cross-examination for witnesses testifying under pseudonyms, specifically regarding questions about the 'genre' of their careers.",
    "The government argues that allowing detailed questioning about the specific type of movie or TV show a witness worked on (e.g., action movie vs. soap opera) creates a significant risk of identifying the witness and has no impeachment value.",
    "The government also seeks a court order to bar courtroom sketch artists from drawing the exact likenesses of witnesses testifying under pseudonyms or first names, citing a similar order from the Raniere case.",
    "The document references 'Minor Victims and witnesses' whose privacy the government is seeking to protect through these procedural requests."
