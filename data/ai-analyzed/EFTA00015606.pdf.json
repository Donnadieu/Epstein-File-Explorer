    "Defense counsel argued the New York indictment is a 'do-over' of the previously resolved Florida case, hinges on 'ancient' conduct (2002-2005), and that the charges misapply trafficking statutes meant for more coercive scenarios.",
    "A search of Epstein's Manhattan mansion on July 6, 2019, revealed a massage room set up as described by victims and a locked safe containing hundreds/thousands of sexually suggestive photographs of nude females, some appearing underage, with labels like 'Young Miscellaneous Nudes 1'.",
