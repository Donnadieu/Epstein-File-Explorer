    "The document records an interview with the MCC Warden about prison count procedures, specifically what happens if a count is wrong or missing.",
    "The Warden explained that if a count slip is false or not turned in, a 'bed book count' is conducted for the specific housing unit, and if that fails repeatedly, a whole institution count is performed.",
    "The Warden stated he had never been part of a whole institution bed book count and had never been at an institution that didn't 'clear account'.",
    "The protocol for a missing inmate, after counts fail to resolve the issue, is for the Warden to be notified, who then alerts the regional director.",
    "The correspondence is dated November 2019, following Jeffrey Epstein's death in August 2019 at the MCC, suggesting it is part of a post-incident review of procedures."
