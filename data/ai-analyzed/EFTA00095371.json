  "summary": "This is a federal court opinion and order by Judge Lorna G. Schofield regarding a plaintiff's motion to dismiss her civil lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell and the executors of Jeffrey Epstein's estate with prejudice. The dismissal is connected to the plaintiff's participation in and acceptance of an offer from the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program. The order grants the dismissal with modified conditions, rejecting Maxwell's request for an unredacted copy of the release but striking language about each party bearing its own costs.",
