Nathan, outlining the government's plan to obtain and review investigative files from other agencies, particularly those related to the prior Florida investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, for potential disclosure in the Ghislaine Maxwell case. It details the scope of discovery produced and the legal framework governing disclosure obligations. This is a government filing from the Southern District of New York in the Ghislaine Maxwell case, outlining the prosecution's approach to reviewing materials from prior investigations (specifically the USAO-SDFL Florida investigation and USAO-SDGA's involvement in CVRA civil litigation) for potential Giglio and 3500 material. It details the scope of the email review and affirms the prosecution team's commitment to disclosure obligations.",
