    "The U.S. Attorney's Office urgently needed the evidence to support possible additional charges in the case, indicating an active investigative phase in mid-2020.",
    "Previous data transfers (over 1 million documents) were in an unusable format for discovery, necessitating a complete re-production of raw data in a searchable format.",
    "Evidence was seized from searches in July and September (likely 2019) at Epstein's New York and U.S. Virgin Islands residences, and from his person upon arrest."
