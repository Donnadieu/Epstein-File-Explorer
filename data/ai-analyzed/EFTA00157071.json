    "As of August 9, 2019, the FBI had seized and was processing a significant number of electronic devices from Jeffrey Epstein, including 3 iPads, 1 iPhone, multiple iMacs, external hard drives, and loose media.",
    "Several devices presented technical challenges: one iMac was locked and could not be imaged, and one external hard drive was imaged but encrypted.",
    "No review of the device contents had been conducted at that time, pending a 'taint review' to address potential legal or procedural issues.",
    "The communication indicates an active and ongoing forensic examination of Epstein's digital evidence following his arrest."
