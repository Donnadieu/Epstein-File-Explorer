  "keyFacts": [
    "The power outage was caused by a fire damaging the Priority 3 electrical switchgear, but it did not affect the heating systems (Priority 1 & 2). Heating issues were due to pre-existing, long-standing temperature regulation problems in the West Building.",
    "Temperatures in some inmate housing units fell below the BOP's winter target of 68°F before, during, and after the outage, with one recorded temperature as low as 59°F a week before the fire. The OIG could not determine the full extent due to unreliable temperature measurement methods.",
    "MDC Brooklyn management canceled all legal and social visiting for a week due to security concerns from low lighting but failed to effectively communicate the reasons or develop timely alternative plans, severely impacting pretrial inmates' access to counsel.",
    "The BOP and MDC Brooklyn failed to provide proactive, timely information to defense counsel, courts, families, the public, and Congress about the outage and conditions. This led to confusion, media crises, protests, multiple lawsuits, and congressional scrutiny.",
    "The facility lacked a Building Management System (BMS) to monitor temperatures, and its contingency plans did not guide staff on communicating with external stakeholders or handling inmates dependent on electronic medical devices like CPAP machines during a power outage."
