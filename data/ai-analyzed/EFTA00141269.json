    "The interviewee, a supervisor at MCC, stated she initially believed Epstein went to court on August 9, 2019, and only learned during this interview that he was actually transferred (WAB/Pre-Remove).",
    "Standard procedure required the SHU Lieutenant (LT) or Operations LT to authorize an inmate's key-out from SHU to R&D; SHU staff could not do it themselves.",
    "The interviewee expressed surprise that a staff member (Tova Noel) allegedly did not perform inmate counts, calling it 'Corrections 101.'",
    "Court lists and transfer documents like the '64' transit form were not maintained; they were typically deleted or discarded after use.",
    "If an inmate listed as WAB (not returning) left SHU, it was not acceptable for SHU staff to think the inmate might return; they should have known."
