    "There were significant delays in processing evidence for the Epstein case, with over 40,000 images and documents from FBI sources awaiting production as of late October 2020.",
    "A contractor (PAE) had de-duplicated images without prior authorization, causing a rework and contributing to the delay.",
    "Approximately 1.2 million records were still being imaged, with availability not expected until at least November 2, 2020, making the November 9 production deadline unlikely to be fully met.",
    "The email chain involves personnel from the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (USANYS), but their names are redacted."
