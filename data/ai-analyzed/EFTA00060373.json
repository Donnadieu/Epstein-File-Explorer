  "summary": "This is a transcript of a voluntary sworn interview conducted by DOJ OIG Senior Special Agents with a Bureau of Prisons Lieutenant at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York on July 14, 2021. The interview is part of the OIG investigation into the death of inmate Jeffrey Epstein and focuses on the circumstances surrounding his housing and supervision in the Special Housing Unit (SHU) in July and August 2019, particularly the requirement for him to have a cellmate. This is a transcript of an OIG interview with a BOP Lieutenant (formerly a SHU OIC) regarding the events at MCC New York on August 9-10, 2019, the day before Jeffrey Epstein's death. The interview focuses on inmate counts, rounds, cellmate assignment procedures, staff responsibilities, and potential failures in protocol that left Epstein without a cellmate.",

    "The witness stated that inmate Nicholas Tartaglione, a former cellmate of Epstein's, always got along with Epstein and he had no reason to believe Tartaglione wanted to harm him, contradicting rumors.",
    "The witness informed oncoming staff on August 9, 2019, that inmate Efrain Reyes was leaving (WAB) and that Epstein would need a new cellmate upon returning from his legal visit.",
    "The 'hot list' (a list of inmates with past suicide attempts) was posted in the SHU, and the witness believed Epstein was on it. Inmates on the hot list were required to have cellmates.",
    "The interviewee (Lieutenant) is 'very, very confident' he told multiple lieutenants and officers on August 9th that Reyes was leaving and Epstein would need a new bunkie if Reyes didn't return.",
    "Evidence from count slips suggests staff on the evening and morning watches of August 9-10 may have falsified counts, writing numbers that matched incorrect institutional data rather than physically counting inmates.",
    "Epstein was housed in SHU cell 220, but was incorrectly keyed in the BOP system as being in cell 206L, an administrative error that should have been caught in a bed book count.",
    "The interviewee states that 'everybody in the building' knew Reyes was Epstein's cellmate, making it unacceptable for anyone to claim ignorance of the need to replace him.",
    "The interviewee believes Epstein's suicide was more likely because he lacked a cellmate, and that he was released from suicide watch too early because 'he was Epstein.'"
