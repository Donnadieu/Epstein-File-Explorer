The motion alleges the government made false statements to Judge McMahon to circumvent a protective order from the Giuffre v. Maxwell defamation case, violating due process.",

    "The motion seeks to suppress all evidence obtained from Boies Schiller Flexner LLP via a grand jury subpoena and to dismiss perjury Counts Five and Six, which are based on Maxwell's 2016 civil deposition transcripts.",
    "It alleges the government made false statements to Judge McMahon, claiming no prior contact with Boies Schiller and that the firm did not 'foment' the investigation, when in fact the firm had urged prosecution as early as February 2016.",
    "A protective order in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case strictly limited disclosure of confidential discovery, with no law enforcement exception, and required return or destruction of materials upon case conclusion.",
    "Maxwell argues she relied on this protective order in agreeing to give extensive, intimate testimony rather than invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege.",
    "Magistrate Judge Netburn rejected a similar government request in a related case, noting the government was attempting to 'side-step' protections and that Boies Schiller was 'willing (and perhaps eager)' to comply."
