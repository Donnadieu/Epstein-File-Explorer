    "The motion seeks to suppress all evidence obtained from Boies Schiller Flexner LLP via grand jury subpoena and to dismiss perjury Counts Five and Six, which are based on Maxwell's 2016 civil deposition transcripts.",
    "It alleges the government made false statements to Judge McMahon, claiming no prior contact with Boies Schiller and that the firm did not 'foment' the investigation, when in fact the firm had urged prosecution as early as February 2016.",
    "A protective order in Giuffre v. Maxwell, which lacked a 'law enforcement exception,' was secretly modified via an ex parte proceeding after the government's alleged misrepresentations.",
    "Maxwell's defense argues she relied on this protective order's confidentiality to answer intimate questions in her depositions instead of invoking the Fifth Amendment.",
    "The motion references a contrasting ruling by Magistrate Judge Netburn, who rejected a similar government tactic in a related case, noting the government was trying to 'side-step' protections by subpoenaing a 'willing (and perhaps eager)' party."
