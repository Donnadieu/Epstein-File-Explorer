  "summary": "This is a memorandum opinion and order by Judge Alison J. Nathan in the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal case, ruling on the government's motion to preclude the expert testimony of Dr. Ryan Hall. The court precludes Dr. Hall from testifying as an expert about his 2009 psychological evaluation of 'Alleged Victim 4' (a Jane Doe), finding the diagnoses irrelevant, remote in time, and unfairly prejudicial. The court reserves judgment on whether Dr. Hall could offer limited fact testimony.",

    "The court precluded defense expert Dr. Ryan Hall from testifying about his 2009 psychological diagnoses of 'Alleged Victim 4', finding the 12-year-old report too remote, irrelevant to credibility, and unfairly prejudicial under Federal Rules of Evidence 401, 403, and 702.",
    "Dr. Hall's report diagnosed the victim with narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, depression, bulimia, and polysubstance abuse, and concluded Epstein's abuse accounted for only '0-5%' of her psychiatric issues.",
    "A key factual point noted in the document is that during Dr. Hall's 2009 evaluation, 'Alleged Victim 4' did not identify Ghislaine Maxwell as a perpetrator of any abuse.",
    "The court ruled that the defense could cross-examine 'Alleged Victim 4' about her substance use but could not admit Dr. Hall's expert diagnosis of addiction, following Second Circuit precedent distinguishing cross-examination from formal expert testimony.",
    "The court reserved judgment on whether Dr. Hall could offer limited fact testimony (e.g., that the victim did not name Maxwell) as a potential prior inconsistent statement, depending on how the victim testified at trial."
