    "The document explains that the government's burden of proof for the focus group exercise is 'preponderance of the evidence' (more likely than not), not 'beyond a reasonable doubt' as in a criminal trial.",
    "Count One involves transporting minors with intent for sexual activity under New York law, where a person under 17 cannot consent.",
    "Count Two and Three involve sex trafficking, defined as recruiting/transporting a person under 18 knowing they would engage in a commercial sex act.",
    "The document mentions that Maxwell could be found guilty under an 'aiding and abetting' theory for Count Three if she assisted others in committing the crime."
