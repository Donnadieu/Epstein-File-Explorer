    "The email chain involves negotiations between defense attorney Andrew Patel and government prosecutors over the disclosure of notes related to a client (Mr. [redacted]) in the Epstein case.",
    "Andrew Patel argues the notes are not 3500 material, Rule 16 material, or Brady material, but rather an error by his client contradicted by surveillance video evidence.",
    "Patel proposes filing a motion under seal before Judge Torres for a protective order to preclude disclosure, aiming to protect his client from harm due to the release of information about meeting with the government.",
    "The government initially intended to produce redacted copies of the notes pursuant to a protective order and provide the client's name and contact information to defense counsel on an AE0 basis, with the file name changed to a bates number to exclude the name."
