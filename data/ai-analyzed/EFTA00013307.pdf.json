  "summary": "This is a federal court opinion and order by Judge Alison J. Nathan denying Ghislaine Maxwell's renewed motion for release on bail pending trial. The court reaffirms its earlier finding that Maxwell is a substantial flight risk due to the seriousness of the charges, strong evidence, her substantial financial resources, foreign ties, and lack of candor about her finances. The opinion details the proposed $28.5 million bail package and additional conditions but concludes they are insufficient to assure her appearance.",
