    "The defense plans to call forensic psychiatrist Dr. Park Dietz to challenge the prosecution's theory of 'grooming', arguing the term imputes motive without evidence and that a theory of 'grooming-by-proxy' has no scientific support.",
    "Dr. Dietz will testify about cognitive biases relevant to the case, including 'hindsight bias' (judging past events as more predictable after knowing the outcome) and the 'halo effect' (where positive traits like wealth or status influence other judgments).",
    "Dr. Dietz cites a videotaped interview where Jeffrey Epstein told Steve Bannon that he 'gravitated to people of power,' such as Bill Clinton's political power or Gerry Edelman's intellectual power.",
    "Dr. Dietz outlines 11 potential 'pathways to false allegations of sexual assault,' including lying, false memories, intoxication, and various personality disorders, drawing from a peer-reviewed article.",
    "The defense outlines multiple psychological pathways they argue can lead to false allegations of sexual assault, including false memory, intoxication, and various personality disorders (antisocial, borderline, histrionic).",
    "The defense cites academic research to argue that emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not a reliable predictor of the truthfulness of a sexual assault allegation.",
    "The defense provides notice of several expert witnesses they intend to call, including a forensic psychiatrist (Ryan Hall), a prosecutorial misconduct expert (Bennett Gershman), and specialists in computer forensics, financial investigation, and document examination.",
    "A key point from Dr. Hall's evaluation is that the evaluated individual 'did not identify Ms. Maxwell as a perpetrator of any abuse.'",
    "The document is a strategic defense filing aiming to cast doubt on accusers' credibility and challenge the prosecution's evidence through expert testimony."
