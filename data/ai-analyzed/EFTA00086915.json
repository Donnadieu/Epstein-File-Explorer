  "summary": "This is a court opinion and order by Judge Alison J. Nathan denying Ghislaine Maxwell's renewed motion for release on bail pending trial. The court reaffirms its earlier finding that Maxwell is a substantial flight risk due to the seriousness of the charges, strong evidence, her substantial financial resources, foreign ties, and lack of candor about her finances. The opinion details the proposed bail package and the court's reasons for rejecting it.",
