While it contains case identifiers like SDNY_00007663 and EFTA00098080, and mentions names like 'Epstein' and 'Ghislaine', the text is largely unreadable with many character errors and fragments. No clear narrative or structured information can be extracted.",

    "The document text is severely garbled and contains many character recognition errors, making meaningful analysis impossible.",
    "The file identifiers SDNY_00007663 and EFTA00098080-82 suggest it is part of the Epstein case document release from the Southern District of New York.",
    "The names 'Epstein' and what appears to be 'Ghislaine' are partially visible in the corrupted text.",
    "No coherent sentences, dates, events, or clear relationships can be reliably extracted from this text.",
    "The document appears to be a technical artifact rather than a readable legal or investigative record."
