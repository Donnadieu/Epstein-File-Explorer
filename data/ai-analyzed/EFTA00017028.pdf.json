  "keyFacts": [
    "The FBI seized approximately 40+ electronic devices from Epstein's New York mansion and 25+ devices from his U.S. Virgin Islands residence in August/September 2019.",
    "Significant technical problems existed with previously transferred data: emails could not be linked to attachments, load files did not match native files, and many large files were inaccessible.",
    "Processing of the seized evidence was severely delayed, with the U.S. Attorney's Office still seeking a complete inventory and raw data transfer eight months after the searches.",
    "The volume of data was substantial, with one recent transfer alone containing over 600,000 items and total documents exceeding one million.",
    "The correspondence reveals internal frustration with the FBI's evidence handling and discusses potentially outsourcing processing to external vendors like Kroll or BRG."
