    "Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide on August 10, 2019, while in pretrial custody at MCC New York on federal sex trafficking charges.",
    "The reconstruction was severely limited because the FBI confiscated the original video of the incident and formal interviews were not conducted to avoid interfering with other DOJ investigations.",
    "On July 23, 2019, Epstein was found with a cloth around his neck in an incident initially reported as self-mutilation; he claimed his cellmate Nicholas Tartaglione tried to kill him, but the investigation was inconclusive.",
    "Critical operational failures were identified, including failure to complete 30-minute rounds, inaccurate inmate cell assignments in SENTRY, improper documentation, and Epstein being left single-celled on the night of his death despite policy.",
    "On August 9, 2019, the day before his death, approximately 2,000 pages of court documents containing graphic allegations were unsealed, which the report suggests contributed to his distress."
