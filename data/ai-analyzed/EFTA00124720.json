    "The document is a personal bank statement for an individual named A Noel, with no apparent direct connection to Jeffrey Epstein, his associates, or his criminal activities.",
    "Account activity shows deposits from U.S. federal government entities (DFEC TREAS 310 and AGRI TREAS 310), indicating the account holder may be a federal employee.",
    "The statement period is July 2019, which is after Epstein's July 2019 arrest but before his death in August 2019.",
    "Transaction details are routine personal expenditures (food, retail, Uber, bills) with no suspicious or large transfers indicative of the Epstein case.",
    "The document is labeled as part of the Epstein case data set, but its relevance is not evident from the content; it may be part of a broader financial discovery or belong to a person tangentially involved."
