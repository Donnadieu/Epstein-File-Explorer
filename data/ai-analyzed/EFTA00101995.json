Maxwell sought to use discovery materials from her criminal case in related civil proceedings. The court found her arguments insufficient to establish good cause for modification, though it permitted her to share specific, already-public information about grand jury subpoenas with the relevant civil courts under seal.",

    "The court found Maxwell's arguments for modification were 'vague, speculative, and conclusory' and failed to establish good cause.",
    "The document reveals that grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity (the 'Recipient') as part of an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators.",
    "The government had previously sought, ex parte and under seal, to modify civil protective orders to obtain materials responsive to the grand jury subpoenas, with mixed results from different courts.",
    "The court permitted Maxwell to share specific, already-public information about the grand jury subpoena process with the relevant civil courts under seal, and to make applications to unseal materials in those courts."
