    "Jeffrey Epstein arrived at MCC unexpectedly on a weekend without prior notification to the Warden. He was initially placed in the Special Housing Unit (SHU) and was never moved to general population on orders from the Regional Director.",
    "Epstein had a prior incident on July 23, 2019, where he was found with a cloth around his neck. He denied a suicide attempt, saying he thought he was having a heart attack. He was placed on suicide watch and later downgraded to psychological observation before returning to the SHU with a cellmate ().",
    "The Warden gave explicit orders that Epstein was to have a cellmate 'at all times' and instructed Captain to disseminate this to staff. However, after cellmate was discharged on August 9, Epstein was left alone in his cell. Staff failed to notify supervisors or find a replacement cellmate as instructed.",
    "The MCC was understaffed (approx. 80%), relied on overtime, and had outdated, unreliable camera systems. The SIS Lieutenant had reported problems with the SHU camera recordings prior to Epstein's death.",
    "On the morning of August 10, Officers Michael Thomas and Toba Noel were on duty in the SHU. The Warden stated that 30-minute inmate checks were not performed at 3 PM and 5 PM. Thomas was the first to respond to Epstein, initiating life-saving measures against protocol which advises waiting for backup."
