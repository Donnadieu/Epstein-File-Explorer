    "The document records an interview with an MCC employee (EMPLOYEE 32) about jail count procedures conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.",
    "EMPLOYEE 32 explained that if a count slip is missing or false, and the count doesn't match the roster, the MCC must conduct a bed book count for the specific housing unit.",
    "If a housing unit fails a bed book count more than once, a full institution-wide count would be conducted.",
    "EMPLOYEE 32 stated that if an institutional count did not clear and a bed book count didn't resolve the issue, the warden would be notified of a missing inmate and a potential escape, and the warden would then notify the regional director.",
    "The document is dated November 13, 2019, and appears to be part of an investigation into jail procedures, likely related to the circumstances surrounding Jeffrey Epstein's death in August 2019."
