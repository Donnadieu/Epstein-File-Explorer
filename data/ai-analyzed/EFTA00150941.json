    "Law enforcement was actively pursuing interviews with former employees of Jeffrey Epstein in July 2019 as part of the investigation into abuse at his New York home.",
    "One identified former employee, Natividad Ruperez, was approximately 80 years old at the time and was believed to have worked at Epstein's New York address prior to Epstein living there, when it was owned by Wexner.",
    "Investigators had obtained subpoenas and conducted background checks (Accurint and DMV) to locate Ruperez, finding he had been living in Nassau County since 2000.",
    "A second former New York employee was also sought, but investigators lacked a date of birth or good address for him at the time of the email.",
    "The planned interview questions focused on the employee's knowledge of Epstein, the massage room, and the comings and goings of girls at the residence."
