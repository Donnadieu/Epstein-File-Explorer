    "The documents are routine Bureau of Prisons administrative records from the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York, dated August 13, 2019.",

    "Several inmate records include notes such as 'SUICIDE OR UNASSG' or 'SUICIDE OR', which are likely standard prison codes for monitoring or assignment status, not necessarily indicating an event on that date.",
    "The documents do not contain any direct references to Jeffrey Epstein, his case, or associated individuals; they appear to be standard prison operations paperwork.",
    "The forms emphasize strict procedures, requiring submission in ink 45 minutes prior to counts and grouping inmates by housing unit."
