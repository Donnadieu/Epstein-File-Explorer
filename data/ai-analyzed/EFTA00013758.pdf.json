    "Epstein's defense team, led by Jay Lefkowitz, strongly objected to the government sending notification letters to alleged victims about their civil rights under the non-prosecution agreement, calling it 'unprecedented' and 'incendiary'.",
    "The defense argued that the Justice for All Act of 2004 (which mandates victim notification) did not apply to the civil remedy (18 USC §2255) portion of the agreement, claiming it was not a restitution statute.",
    "Judge Davis had selected attorneys Aaron Podhurst and Bob Josephsberg to handle the civil remedy portion, a selection the defense eventually accepted despite initial procedural objections.",
    "The defense revealed they had previously offered to establish a restitution fund for victims, but this option was rejected by the U.S. Attorney's Office.",
    "The correspondence shows high-level legal scrutiny of the agreement, with Judge Starr seeking a meeting with an Assistant Attorney General to discuss the 'unprecedented' nature of the §2255 component."
