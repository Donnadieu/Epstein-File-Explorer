  "keyFacts": [
    "The government is seeking clarification from Judge Nathan on the permissible scope of cross-examination for witnesses testifying under pseudonyms, specifically regarding questions about their careers.",
    "The government argues that eliciting specific details about a witness's career (e.g., type of TV show or movie) creates a risk of identifying the pseudonymous minor victims and witnesses.",
    "The government also seeks a court order to prevent courtroom sketch artists from drawing the exact likenesses of pseudonymous witnesses to protect their anonymity.",
    "The letter references a prior case (Raniere, 18 Cr. 204) where a similar order regarding sketch artists was issued.",
    "The proposed redactions in the letter are justified under the Second Circuit's test in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. to protect witness privacy."
