    "Dr. Lisa Rocchio, a clinician, has treated victims who have themselves engaged in sexually abusive behavior or intimate partner violence, though treating perpetrators is not her specialization.",
    "She describes a clinical approach that relies on patient self-report while probing for inconsistencies, using screening measures, and consulting peers or other experts when presentations are unexpected.",
    "The document outlines general grooming techniques used by perpetrators, such as building false safety through shared interests and gradually escalating deviant behavior to normalize abuse.",
    "The call was likely part of legal case preparation, as evidenced by the request for literature on attachment, grooming, and delayed disclosure, and the document being subject to a protective order."
