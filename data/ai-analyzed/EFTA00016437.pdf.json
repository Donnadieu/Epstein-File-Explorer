    "The FBI seized a massive amount of digital evidence from Epstein's properties, including computers, hard drives, thumb drives, CDs, phones, tablets, cameras, DVRs, and servers, totaling terabytes of data.",
    "Significant technical and coordination problems plagued the evidence transfer, including unusable data formats, inability to link emails with attachments, and lack of proper inventory tracking.",
    "Evidence included items from a prior July 2007 search of one of Epstein's properties, specifically 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment.",
    "The U.S. Attorney's Office needed the evidence in a specific format for loading into Relativity, an e-discovery tool, to conduct taint review and produce materials to defense counsel.",
    "The email chain reveals ongoing frustration and delays in accessing and reviewing the evidence, with the process still unresolved nearly a year after the seizures."
