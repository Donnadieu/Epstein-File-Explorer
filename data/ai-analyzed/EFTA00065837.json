    "A U.S. Department of Justice Attaché noted that a public statement from the State Department was 'unhelpful' and likely came from someone 'spouting off'.",
    "Investigators are interested in Prince Andrew's flights to visit Epstein in locations like Little St James, Florida, and New York to understand travel within Epstein's network.",
    "The lack of cooperation is amplified by the unlikelihood of Prince Andrew's extradition, making his voluntary assistance a matter of diplomatic relations."
