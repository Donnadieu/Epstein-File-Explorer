  "summary": "This is a legal memorandum filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team in support of a motion to suppress evidence and dismiss counts. The motion argues that the government's grand jury subpoena to a third party (redacted) for Maxwell's confidential deposition transcripts from a civil case violated the Fourth Amendment (overbroad, warrantless search/seizure), the Martindell doctrine (bypassing protective order procedures), and the Fifth Amendment (self-incrimination). The defense seeks suppression of all evidence obtained from the subpoena and dismissal of Counts Five and Six.",
