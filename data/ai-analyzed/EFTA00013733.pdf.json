  "keyFacts": [
    "As of May 2007, Jeffrey Epstein was the subject of an active federal grand jury investigation in the Southern District of Florida.",
    "Epstein's lead attorney, Gerald B. Lefcourt, was proactively engaging with prosecutors to present Epstein's case before an indictment decision was made.",
    "The letter reveals a planned, multi-tiered defense strategy: first meeting with line prosecutors, then with the Chief of the Criminal Division and First Assistant U.S. Attorney, and finally with U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta himself.",
    "The letter frames the decision to indict Epstein as requiring 'complex legal analysis' and resolution of 'significant policy concerns,' suggesting the defense anticipated high-level negotiations.",
    "The correspondence is dated over a year before Epstein's eventual non-prosecution agreement (NPA) was finalized in 2008, showing early legal maneuvering."
