    "The document is an email chain from late February 2002 planning activities for an unnamed visitor (referred to as 'he' and signing as 'A') to Peru.",
    "Proposed activities include riding Peruvian Paso horses, visiting the Nazca Lines, playing polo, water-skiing in Paracas, and having private lunches.",
    "The email from Juan Esteban Ganoza explicitly asks 'About the girls... how old is he ? I doubt it that he will find someone here, but we can try.'",
    "The visitor's response states: 'As for girls well I leave that entirely to you and Juan Estoban!'",
    "The context and phrasing suggest the visitor is likely Jeffrey Epstein, given the pattern of travel and the discussion of arranging female companionship."
