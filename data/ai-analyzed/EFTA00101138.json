    "The U.S. Attorney's Office (SDNY) was urgently preparing a 1TB hard drive containing approximately 40,000 files (300GB) of Epstein/Maxwell investigation materials for discovery production in October 2020.",
    "The materials included 'Images Seized During Search' from the FBI case file, indicating they were evidence obtained via search warrant.",
    "The production process involved bates stamping, applying confidential stamps, and uploading to the Relativity database for legal review.",
    "A significant discrepancy was noted: a drive contained about 41,000 files, but only about 22,000 appeared in two productions, raising questions about non-imaged native files.",
    "The email chain shows active case management and evidence processing in the Epstein/Maxwell investigation years after Epstein's death."
