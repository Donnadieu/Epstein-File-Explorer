Nathan in the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal case, addressing the government's motion to require attorney David Markus to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.1 regarding extrajudicial statements.

  "keyFacts": [
    "The court found attorney David Markus was 'associated' with Ghislaine Maxwell's defense and therefore bound by Local Criminal Rule 23.1, which restricts extrajudicial statements by lawyers involved in pending criminal litigation.",
    "Markus argued he was not subject to the rule because he had not made a formal appearance in the district court, only handling appellate matters on bail, but the court rejected this as an easy circumvention.",
    "The court highlighted Markus's specific actions: representing Maxwell on bail appeal, attending a proceeding, speaking to the press on her behalf, and authoring an op-ed describing himself as 'Maxwell's appellate counsel.'",
    "The order serves as a warning to all lawyers, agents, and counsel for potential witnesses associated with the case to avoid public statements that could prejudice the trial or risk attorney discipline.",
    "The government did not seek discipline for Markus's op-ed, and the court declined to rule on whether it violated the rule, focusing instead on clarifying the rule's application going forward."
