    "The witness clarifies that if two drives in a RAID 5 configuration fail, all data is lost and the array must be rebuilt from scratch. He also states the MCC system did not have email alerting enabled, so staff would have to manually check for system failures.",
    "There is a discrepancy explored between the service ticket timeline (events concentrated August 8-10) and the witness's personal recollection of being on a weekend camping trip and communicating with Derek.",
    "The OIG agents are interested in the period from July 29, 2019, onward, suggesting the drive issues may have begun earlier than the August 8 service request."
