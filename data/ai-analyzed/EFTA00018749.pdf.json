  "summary": "This is a letter motion filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense attorneys, Haddon, Morgan and Foreman, to Judge Alison J. Nathan. Maxwell requests modification of the protective order in her criminal case to allow her to reference and file under seal certain government-produced discovery materials in related civil cases (Giuffre v. Maxwell and a Second Circuit appeal). The motion reveals that the government secretly obtained thousands of pages of sealed civil case materials from the law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner (BSF) via ex parte proceedings, which Maxwell argues undermines the fairness of the civil unsealing process and her due process rights. This document is a legal letter motion filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's attorney, Jeffrey S. Pagliuca, requesting modification of a protective order. Maxwell seeks permission to reference and file under seal certain material in the civil litigation Giuffre v. Maxwell and its related Second Circuit appeal.",
