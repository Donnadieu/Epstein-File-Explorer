  "summary": "This is a court order from Judge Richard M. Berman denying Jeffrey Epstein's motion for pretrial release and ordering his detention pending trial.

This document contains email correspondence from October 2007 between Assistant U.S. Attorney Ann Marie C. Villafana and attorney Jay Lefkowitz, discussing potential plea agreements and obstruction charges against Jeffrey Epstein. It references factual bases for charges, including incidents involving Epstein's private investigators and travel to avoid service of process.",
