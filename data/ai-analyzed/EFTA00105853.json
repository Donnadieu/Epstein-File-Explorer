  "summary": "This is an email chain among U.S. Attorney's Office (USANYS) personnel discussing scheduling and substantive updates regarding a FOIA case related to Jeffrey Epstein. The emails detail a recent oral argument before Judge Engelmayer, who expressed skepticism about the breadth of the government's withholdings under FOIA Exemption 7(A) and ordered an in camera review. The court also directed communication with Audrey (likely a supervisor) about reconsidering the FOIA response, possibly in light of a change in administration.",
