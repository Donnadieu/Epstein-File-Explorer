  "summary": "This is a declaration by BOP Staff Attorney Nicole McFarland filed in a FOIA lawsuit brought by The New York Times against the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The declaration details the searches conducted at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) for records related to Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration, suicide attempt, and death, in response to the Times' FOIA requests. It reveals that many key records (like SHU logs, video footage) were handed over to investigative agencies and that searches for meeting minutes about Epstein's removal from suicide watch were unsuccessful.",
