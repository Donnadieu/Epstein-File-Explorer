    "Prosecutors, including U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta, were negotiating directly with Epstein's defense attorney, Jay Lefkowitz, on the process for victim settlements.",
    "The defense successfully pushed for the removal of language requiring a law firm 'sizeable enough to litigate multiple trials simultaneously,' arguing it was at odds with the goal of out-of-court settlements.",
    "Epstein had agreed to pay an attorney's hourly rate, but only for time spent 'working to effectuate settlements,' not for litigation.",
    "The correspondence reveals prosecutorial concessions to the defense, including adding language about testing 'the veracity of the victims' claims' through discovery.",
    "A financial parameter discussed was a '$150k statutory limit' for settlements, with a note about a pre-existing '$50G limit,' indicating negotiated caps on victim payouts."
