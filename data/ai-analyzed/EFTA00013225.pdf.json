    "Ghislaine Maxwell's defense attorneys claim she has been denied full access to the 'core' discovery evidence against her for over a month due to technical issues with unreadable file formats (.XLS, .EML) and delayed deliveries.",
    "Maxwell is described as being held in solitary confinement-like conditions for over 80 days, under constant surveillance by 2-3 guards and two cameras, despite not being on suicide watch.",
    "The letter alleges Maxwell is subjected to excessive searches, including frequent strip searches and mouth searches, and receives inadequate, sometimes inedible food, leading to significant weight loss.",
    "Defense counsel asserts Maxwell's conditions are uniquely harsh, with multiple wardens reportedly stating they had never seen anything like her regime in their collective experience.",
    "The letter serves as a formal demand for government intervention with the BOP to improve conditions and a threat to seek court intervention if issues are not addressed expeditiously."
