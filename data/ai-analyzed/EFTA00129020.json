  "summary": "This document is a news article reporting on a legal filing by JPMorgan Chase attorney Felecia Ellsworth, who argues that the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) government is improperly blocking the release of public records related to Jeffrey Epstein. The bank claims the records are being withheld not due to confidentiality but because they are embarrassing to government officials who had dealings with Epstein. The article details the ongoing lawsuit where the USVI government is suing JPMorgan for keeping Epstein as a client, and the bank is countering that USVI officials were aware of Epstein's activities.",
