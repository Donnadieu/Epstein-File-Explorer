  "keyFacts": [
    "The document reveals significant disparities in accommodations: Ghislaine Maxwell received 13 hours/day of electronic discovery access and 15 hours/week of video counsel visits, while Justin Rivera initially received only 3 hours/day and 6 hours/week.",
    "The disparities are attributed to Maxwell's unique protective custody housing at MDC (sole access to a room) versus Rivera's general population housing at MCC (shared facilities with ~80 other inmates).",
    "Judge Engelmayer found the disparity in treatment 'jumped off the page' with 'terrible' optics and raised concerns about potential discrimination based on race, gender, and class.",
    "By the time of the email, the MCC had begun leaving a laptop with Rivera all day, matching Maxwell's electronic access, but video conference access remained limited due to shared facility constraints.",
    "The email chain shows coordination between the U.S. Attorney's Office and BOP officials to draft a declaration justifying the different treatment based on case-specific circumstances and facility logistics."
