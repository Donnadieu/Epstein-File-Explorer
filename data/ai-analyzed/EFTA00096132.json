  "summary": "This document is an email chain between defense attorney Bobbi C. Sternheim and prosecutors regarding scheduling the trial date for United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell. The defense argues for a November 8, 2021 trial start, citing Maxwell's detention and potential juror impatience if the trial extends into the holidays, while the prosecution proposes November 29, 2021. The defense also links scheduling flexibility to the prosecution consenting to Maxwell's release on bail.",
