  "summary": "This is a legal filing by victims Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 in response to the U.S. Government's notice regarding an evidentiary hearing. The victims argue that the Government violated their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) by entering into a confidential Non-Prosecution Agreement with Jeffrey Epstein in September 2007 without conferring with them. They request the court to order production of the agreement and an FBI interview report, and to find that their rights were violated. This is a legal filing (Document 19) from the civil case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM, submitted by attorneys for Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. It argues the U.S. Government violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) by not conferring with the victims during the negotiation of a Non-Prosecution Agreement with Jeffrey Epstein. The filing requests the court to order the government to produce the full agreement and an FBI interview report, declare the rights violation, and schedule a hearing on remedies.",

    "The U.S. Attorney's Office entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement with Jeffrey Epstein in September 2007, which contained an 'express confidentiality provision' preventing disclosure to victims.",

    "The Government has refused to provide the victims with a copy of the full Non-Prosecution Agreement or an FBI report of interview from October 26, 2007, with Jane Doe #1.",
    "The agreement reportedly contains provisions affecting the civil liability of Epstein for crimes against the victims, which the victims need to see to potentially benefit from or understand.",
    "The U.S. Government negotiated a Non-Prosecution Agreement with Jeffrey Epstein without conferring with the victims, Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2, which they argue violates the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA).",
    "The government possesses an FBI interview report from an October 26, 2007, meeting with Jane Doe #1 but has refused to provide her with a copy, despite her rights as a victim.",
    "The victims are not seeking to invalidate the Non-Prosecution Agreement but are asking the court to declare their rights were violated, order production of the agreement and the interview report, and schedule a hearing on an appropriate remedy.",
    "Jeffrey Epstein attempted to use the existence of the secret Non-Prosecution Agreement to his advantage by filing a motion to stay the civil case on July 25, 2008.",
    "This filing reveals an early legal battle over victim transparency and government accountability in the Epstein case, predating his 2008 plea deal becoming widely known."
