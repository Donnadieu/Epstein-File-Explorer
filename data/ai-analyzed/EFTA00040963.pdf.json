    "The MCC was severely overcrowded (763 inmates vs. a 474 capacity) and understaffed, with staff working excessive overtime, contributing to systemic failures.",
    "The report details horrific, long-standing conditions at MCC, including rodent/insect infestations, sewage floods, lack of medical care, and abusive guards, described by some as 'torture' or a 'gulag'.",
    "Jeffrey Epstein died by suspected suicide in the MCC on August 9, 2019, after being taken off suicide watch and left without a cellmate, despite a prior apparent suicide attempt.",
    "Two guards assigned to check on Epstein every 30 minutes failed to do so for several hours on the night of his death; one was a temporarily reassigned staffer not normally a detention guard.",

    "Specific questions focus on the practice of 'augmentation' (using non-corrections staff for guard duties), excessive overtime (60-80 hour weeks), and inadequate mental health staffing (one shared psychiatrist for two facilities).",
    "The U.S. response is constrained by the ongoing investigation into Epstein's death, but officials seek 'stock language' from the BOP Central Office to address the systemic concerns raised.",
    "The document reveals international legal ramifications of Epstein's death, with another country's court scrutinizing U.S. prison conditions and procedures.",
