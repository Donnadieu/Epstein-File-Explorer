    "Prosecutors were actively gathering evidence to oppose Ghislaine Maxwell's December 2020 bail application, which argued she could not be extradited from France.",
    "French authorities, including the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), provided a letter stating France does not extradite its nationals outside the EU, including to the U.S., and has never derogated from that principle.",
    "The U.S. State Department and DOJ's Office of International Affairs (OIA) researched and confirmed they were unaware of any instance where France extradited a French citizen to the United States.",
    "The correspondence references two specific past cases where U.S. extradition requests for French nationals (Hans Peterson and an individual named Tchikaya) were refused by France on grounds of nationality.",
    "The legal debate included the validity of 'anticipatory waivers of extradition,' with U.S. officials seeking to rebut the defense's claim that such a waiver from Maxwell would be binding in France."
