    "The defense argues it cannot prepare a fair defense without knowing the identities of the three alleged victims (Victims 1-3) referenced in the indictment, as the alleged misconduct occurred roughly 25 years ago in multiple locations.",
    "Ghislaine Maxwell is being held under uniquely harsh conditions at the MDC, including 24-hour surveillance, confinement outside general population beyond COVID quarantine, and severely limited access to discovery, which her attorneys attribute to the fallout from Jeffrey Epstein's death in custody.",
    "The government's initial discovery production of nearly 13,000 pages did not identify Victims 1-3, and the defense argues waiting for full discovery would impair Maxwell's right to a fair trial.",
    "The motion cites legal precedent, including United States v. Cannone and United States v. Warne, supporting pretrial disclosure of victim/witness identities when material to defense preparation.",
    "The defense states that many alleged victims have already spoken publicly, filed civil suits, and given depositions, undermining government concerns about witness intimidation or refusal to testify."
