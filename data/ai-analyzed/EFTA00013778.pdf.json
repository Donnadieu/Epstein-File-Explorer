    "The state indictment involves two victims from 2005, one of whom is also included in the federal indictment. The state charges are for solicitation of adult prostitution, not child exploitation.",
    "A victim from the state case told Epstein her true age and he engaged in sexual intercourse with her just days before her 18th birthday, after which he gave her gifts including lingerie.",
    "Before federal involvement, police were told Epstein would plead to a misdemeanor with no jail time, which prompted the FBI to step in.",
    "Epstein's defense has been subpoenaing victims not included in the state indictment for depositions, potentially to gather information on the federal investigation.",
    "Communication between the federal prosecutor and the State Attorney's Office ceased for over six months due to a defense demand for no contact."
