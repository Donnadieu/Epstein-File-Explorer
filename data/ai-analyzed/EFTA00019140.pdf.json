  "keyFacts": [
    "Ghislaine Maxwell's attorney alleges she is being held in an isolation cell at MDC with conditions described as cold, moist, and filled with a sewage stench, making confinement 'unhealthy, unbearable, and utterly unreasonable.'",
    "Specific basic requests by Maxwell have been denied, including an extra blanket, use of her day mug for water (told to cup her hands), and keeping a snack in her cell.",
    "Attorney Bobbi C. Sternheim, with 35 years of experience representing individuals in high-security facilities, states she has 'never witnessed such inappropriate and outlandish treatment of a non-violent pretrial detainee held on risk of flight.'",
    "The complaint frames the mistreatment as reflecting negatively on the Office of the recipient (likely prosecutors), the Court, and the Bureau of Prisons (BOP).",
    "The immediate request is for a change of cell to a safe location and an extra blanket, with other issues to be addressed later."
