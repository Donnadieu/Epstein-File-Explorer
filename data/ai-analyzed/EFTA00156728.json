  "summary": "This is a peer-reviewed medical journal article titled 'Why Women Don't Report Sexual Assault to the Police: The Influence of Psychosocial Variables and Traumatic Injury.' It presents a study conducted from November 2001 to April 2003 examining factors influencing reporting decisions among female sexual assault victims presenting to a Nurse Examiner Program or Emergency Department in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The study found that 25% of eligible victims did not report to police, with key reasons being not wanting the assailant jailed, a prior relationship with the assailant, and fear of police insensitivity. This document is an excerpt from a medical/forensic academic journal article titled 'Influence of Psychosocial Variables on Reporting Sexual Assault'. It presents a study analyzing factors that influence whether female victims of sexual assault report the crime to police, focusing on demographics, victim-perpetrator relationships, and substance use. The document contains no direct references to the Epstein case, individuals, or specific events related to it.",

  "keyFacts": [
    "25% (106 out of 424) of eligible female sexual assault victims in the study did not report the assault to police, despite consenting to a medical-legal examination.",
    "The three primary psychosocial reasons for not reporting were: not wanting the assailant to go to jail (OR 19.47), fear that police would be insensitive or blame the victim (OR 5.81), and having a prior relationship with the assailant (OR 3.79).",
    "There was no significant difference in the frequency or severity of anogenital or non-genital injuries between victims who reported and those who did not report the assault to police.",
    "Women not reporting were more likely to be employed, have a history of recent alcohol/drug use, have a known assailant, and have a longer time interval between assault and forensic evaluation.",
    "The study challenges the hypothesis that severity of physical injury influences reporting decisions, finding that internal psychological barriers (shame, anxiety, fear) were not significantly associated with the decision to report.",
    "The document is a forensic/medical research article, not a legal or investigative document pertaining to the Epstein case.",
    "The study finds that 25% of women presenting to a sexual assault clinic or ED chose not to report the assault to police.",
    "Key factors for non-reporting include being assaulted by a known assailant, recent alcohol/drug use, employment status, and prolonged time before forensic evaluation.",
    "The most significant reason for non-reporting was 'I do not want the assailant going to jail' (Odds Ratio 19.47).",
    "The document discusses the 'classic rape' stereotype and how assaults that don't fit this pattern are less likely to be reported."
