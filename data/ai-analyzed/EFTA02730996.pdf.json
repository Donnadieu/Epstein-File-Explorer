  "summary": "This is a memorandum from Dechert LLP to the Apollo Conflicts Committee summarizing the findings of an independent investigation into the relationship between Leon Black and Jeffrey Epstein, and any relationship between Epstein and Apollo Global Management. The investigation found no evidence that Black or Apollo employees were involved in Epstein's criminal activities, detailed a professional services relationship from 2012-2017 for which Epstein was paid $158 million, and described the social relationship between Black and Epstein from the mid-1990s to 2018. This document is a report from Dechert LLP to the Apollo Conflicts Committee, detailing the investigation into Leon Black's financial relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. It describes the extensive tax, estate planning, and advisory services Epstein provided to Black from 2012-2017, the significant compensation he received, and the eventual deterioration of their relationship over a fee dispute. This document is a section from an investigative report by the law firm Dechert LLP, prepared for Apollo's Conflicts Committee. It details the findings regarding Leon Black's and Apollo's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, verifying public statements made by Black and Apollo while providing additional context and clarifications on the nature of their financial and professional interactions.",

    "The investigation found no evidence that Leon Black, any Family Office employee, or any Apollo employee was involved in Epstein's criminal activities.",
    "Leon Black paid Jeffrey Epstein $158 million for professional services rendered between 2012 and 2017 related to trust and estate planning, tax, and family office operations.",
    "Black was aware of Epstein's 2008 conviction but believed it was limited to a single instance of soliciting a 17-year-old prostitute and that Epstein had served his time.",
    "Black and Epstein had a social relationship from the mid-1990s to 2018, with Black viewing Epstein as a friend and confidant, and introducing him to his family.",
    "Epstein's entity, Financial Trust Company, purchased 263,257 shares of Apollo's stock in its 2011 IPO, but there was no other evidence of a relationship between Epstein and Apollo.",
    "Jeffrey Epstein provided extensive, bona fide financial advisory services to Leon Black from 2012-2017, including resolving a GRAT issue with a potential $500 million-$1 billion estate tax liability, for which he was paid over $158 million.",
    "Epstein played a central role in developing and managing Black's Family Office, which was initially ill-equipped, but his management style created a toxic work environment.",
    "A major fee dispute arose over the 'step-up basis transaction,' where Epstein demanded $60 million (10% of claimed $600M savings) but ultimately received $20 million after it was determined the idea originated with Black's outside counsel.",
    "Separate from service fees, Black loaned Epstein $30.5 million in 2017, of which only $10 million was repaid before Epstein's death.",
    "Black and Epstein had a reciprocal charitable relationship, each donating to causes at the other's request, including a $10 million donation by Black to Epstein's affiliated charity, Gratitude America.",
    "Leon Black paid Jeffrey Epstein millions of dollars annually from 2012 to 2017 for professional services involving tax, estate planning, and philanthropic advice for his family entities.",
    "Black severed all relations with Epstein by October 2018 due to a fee dispute, Epstein's failure to repay $20 million in loans, and the mischaracterization of fees as tax-deductible.",
    "Epstein's company, Financial Trust Company, purchased shares in Apollo during its 2011 IPO, and Epstein invested alongside Black in a company called Environmental Solutions World Wide in 2011.",
    "The investigative report found Black's public statements about his relationship with Epstein to be 'substantially accurate' but noted that claims Apollo 'never did any business with' Epstein were broad and required nuanced context regarding these financial interactions.",
    "While Black did not pressure Apollo co-founders to hire Epstein, he did attempt to introduce Epstein to them at Epstein's request and spoke positively of his services; neither co-founder retained Epstein."
