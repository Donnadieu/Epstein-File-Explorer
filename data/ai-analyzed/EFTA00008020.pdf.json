  "summary": "This document is an excerpt from the book 'Massage For Dummies' by Steve Capellini and Michel Van Welden, with a foreword by Robin Leach. It includes the book's introduction, table of contents, foreword, and initial chapters. The content is purely instructional about massage techniques, benefits, history, and anatomy, with no direct connection to the Epstein case. The file name (EFTA00008020.pdf) suggests it is part of a document release related to the Epstein case, but the content itself is a published mass-market book.",
