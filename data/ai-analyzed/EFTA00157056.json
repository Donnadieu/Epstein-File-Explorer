    "The document notes that Loftus's studies on false memories are laboratory-based and involve a credible person influencing a subject, but there is no evidence this translates to real-world memory for traumatic events.",
    "It challenges Dietz's opinion by stating that victims of coercive control often feel fondness for the perpetrator and may keep gifts, as abuse is interspersed with positive interactions that build trust and false hope.",
    "The meeting was explicitly for preparation for trial testimony, indicating this document is part of legal proceedings.",
    "The document is subject to a protective order covering specific paragraphs (7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 17), highlighting its confidential nature."
