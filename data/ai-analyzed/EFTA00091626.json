  "summary": "This is a letter from defense attorney Laura A. Menninger to Magistrate Judge Debra Freeman, requesting a pre-motion conference to stay discovery in a civil lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell. The letter argues for a stay based on three grounds: the plaintiff's potential participation in the Epstein Estate's compensation program, an ongoing criminal investigation by the SDNY, and the strength of Maxwell's motion to dismiss based on statute of limitations and venue.",
