    "A French financial intelligence unit (TRACFIN) was investigating a 50,000 Euro transaction from Jeffrey Epstein's USVI company, Gratitude America LTD, to the French association 'ASSOCIATION POUR LA PROMOTION DE LA POLITIQUE CULTURELLE'.",
    "The transaction was flagged for lacking a clear purpose, with suspicions it involved funds from illicit activities, and the French request indicated a potential link to 'a former French Ministry'.",
    "FinCEN identified Epstein as the beneficial owner of Gratitude America LTD and noted he was flagged as a Politically Exposed Person (PEP) due to ties to high-level U.S. government officials.",
    "Internal U.S. government correspondence shows a deconfliction process to approve sharing FinCEN's findings, including three Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), with French authorities."
