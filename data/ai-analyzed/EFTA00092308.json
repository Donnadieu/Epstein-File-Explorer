  "summary": "This is a Second Circuit Court of Appeals opinion deciding appeals from orders denying motions to unseal filings in the defamation lawsuit Virginia Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell. The court vacates the sealing orders, orders the immediate unsealing of the summary judgment record, and remands for particularized review of remaining sealed discovery materials. The opinion discusses the presumption of public access to judicial documents and cautions about the reliability of allegations in court filings.",
