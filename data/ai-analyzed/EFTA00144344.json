  "summary": "A letter from the Marsh Law Firm, representing survivors of Jeffrey Epstein, to the FBI Director, DOJ Inspector General, and Attorney General. It details the FBI's failure to investigate Epstein's sex trafficking and possible child sexual abuse material (CSAM) crimes, citing a client's 1996 report and subsequent inaction. It calls for a comprehensive investigation into these failures. This document is a stipulated motion and subsequent court order from the civil case USVI v. JPMorgan Chase. It establishes a protocol for the Epstein Estate to review video and photo materials (Epstein Media) for child sex abuse material (CSAM) before producing responsive items to Jane Doe 1 and other parties, with a requirement to notify the FBI if potential CSAM is found.",
