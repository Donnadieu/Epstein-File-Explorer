    "The defense claims thousands to hundreds of thousands of photos in discovery are unreadable due to technical problems, impeding their constitutional right to review evidence.",
    "Defense attorney Laura Menninger states that among the 'highly confidential' photos she reviewed, she saw adult nudity but did not see anything that would qualify as child pornography under the statute.",
    "The defense challenges the prosecution's requirement to review adult nudity only in government offices, arguing it imposes an 'extraordinary cost' and impedes their defense preparation.",
    "Technical issues cited include a corrupt Excel spreadsheet (SDNY_GM_00467566), photo files without discernible readers, and an index that fails to match files with Bates stamps or indicate 'highly confidential' status.",
    "Ghislaine Maxwell is attempting to review discovery from her laptop at the Metropolitan Detention Center but is hampered by the load file format and lack of appropriate software."
