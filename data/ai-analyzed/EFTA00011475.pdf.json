  "summary": "This is the Executive Summary of a November 2020 report by the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) investigating the conduct of federal prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida regarding the 2007-2008 resolution of the federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The report examines the negotiation and execution of a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) with Epstein and the office's interactions with victims, concluding that while the prosecutors did not commit professional misconduct, former U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta exercised poor judgment.",
