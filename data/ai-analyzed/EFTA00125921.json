    "The witness, a BOP Captain III and former administrative lieutenant at MCC New York, is interviewed regarding allegations that she instructed CO Tova Noel to falsify training records.",

    "The witness vehemently denies under oath ever giving Noel the sheets to sign or telling her not to date them, stating she only informed Noel she needed to complete the training and that the SHU lieutenant (Rice) was responsible for providing it.",

    "The witness states she was not present at MCC on August 9-10, 2019 (when Epstein died), as she was in Indiana due to her father's stroke, and she believes Epstein took his own life."
