    "The defense faced major technical hurdles reviewing discovery, including corrupt files, missing metadata, unreadable file formats on the MDC laptop, and the inability to match photos with their associated metadata.",

    "The prosecution defined 'Highly Confidential' material broadly to include any nude, partially-nude, or sexualized depictions, not limited to child pornography, requiring in-person review under FBI supervision rather than providing copies to the defense."
