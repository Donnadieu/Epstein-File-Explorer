    "The government had produced over 165,000 pages of discovery to Ghislaine Maxwell's defense within two weeks of the protective order being entered.",
    "The government strongly opposed disclosing the names of victim-witnesses 11 months before trial, citing a desire to protect victim privacy and a lack of legal precedent for such early disclosure.",
    "The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) planned to provide Maxwell extended access to discovery materials from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. daily, contrary to defense claims of limited access.",
    "The government accused Maxwell's defense counsel of attempting to use sealed criminal discovery materials in parallel civil litigation, referencing a public filing in case 'Ghislaine Maxwell, No. 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP)'.",
    "The Superseding Indictment describes relevant time periods, events, conversations with victims, interactions with victims, and specific locations, which the government argued provided adequate notice of the charges."
