    "The SDNY prosecution asserts its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein was initiated independently, without transfer, circumvention, or influence from any other U.S. Attorney's Office, specifically denying defense claims of impropriety.",
    "The government strongly resists the defense's broad discovery requests, characterizing them as 'outlandishly overbroad' and a 'fishing expedition' aimed at uncovering victim identities.",
    "The defense is seeking documents related to a prior Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) from the Southern District of Florida, suggesting a planned motion to dismiss based on that agreement.",
    "The letter reveals the defense requested information from a wide array of non-party entities, including 93 U.S. Attorney's Offices, the DOJ Child Exploitation Section, SEC, DHS, NYPD, and various state and local offices in Florida and New Mexico.",
    "The government states it will only produce materials within its own possession that fall under its legal obligations (Rule 16, Brady, § 3500) and will not direct other agencies or victims' counsel to preserve or produce documents."
