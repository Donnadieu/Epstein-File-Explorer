  "summary": "This is a transcript of a court hearing in the case against Nicholas Tartaglione. The judge addresses a Curcio issue, then rules on a motion to seal letters regarding Tartaglione's prison housing conditions at MCC and MDC. The judge orders the letters unsealed, finding they are judicial documents and the Bureau of Prisons failed to show a compelling interest to overcome the public's right of access. The hearing also briefly touches on a phone issue and scheduling for trial.",
