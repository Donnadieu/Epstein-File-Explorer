    "The court denied Ghislaine Maxwell's request for immediate disclosure of the identities of the three alleged victims referenced in the indictment, calling the request premature.",
    "The court denied Maxwell's request for an order directing the Bureau of Prisons to release her into general population and provide increased access to discovery, noting BOP was already providing 13 hours/day, 7 days/week access.",
    "The court ordered the Government to provide written status updates every 90 days detailing any material changes to Maxwell's confinement conditions, particularly regarding access to legal materials and ability to communicate with counsel.",
    "The charges relate to conduct that allegedly took place many years ago, which the court acknowledged as a factor in considering pretrial disclosure timing.",
    "The Bureau of Prisons was implementing surveillance measures on Maxwell that she deemed 'onerous,' but the court found no evidence these were punitive or improperly motivated."
