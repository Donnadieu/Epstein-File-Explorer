  "summary": "This is a legal memorandum filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in support of the FBI's motion for summary judgment in a FOIA lawsuit brought by Radar Online LLC. The document argues that the FBI properly withheld records related to the investigations and prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell under various FOIA exemptions, primarily to avoid interfering with the then-pending criminal proceedings against Maxwell.",

    "The FBI processed 11,525 pages in response to the FOIA request from October 2017 through June 2019, but fully or partially withheld the vast majority (10,107 pages) under FOIA exemptions.",
    "After Epstein's arrest in July 2019, the FBI categorically asserted FOIA Exemption 7(A) to withhold records, arguing release could interfere with the pending prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "Withheld records included interview notes, grand jury materials, witness statements, flight logs, and communications that could reveal investigative techniques or witness identities.",
    "The FBI's legal argument relies heavily on declarations from Michael G. Seidel (FBI) and a lead AUSA (name redacted) to establish that disclosure would harm law enforcement proceedings.",
    "The document reveals the scale and sensitivity of the Epstein investigation records, highlighting conflicts between public transparency under FOIA and protecting active criminal cases."
