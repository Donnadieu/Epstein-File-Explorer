  "keyFacts": [
    "Dr. Gail Goodman's research indicates people are 'quite accurate about sexual abuse even if it happened many years before' and that error rates for false allegations (commission errors) in very young children (3-5 yo) are 'basically 0'.",
    "Goodman disagrees with Elizabeth Loftus's conclusions on memory malleability, arguing Loftus's laboratory studies don't generalize well to real-world traumatic memory, and that misleading questions do not necessarily contaminate memory of abuse.",
    "Goodman has testified as an expert approximately 40 times in federal, state, and family courts, and has worked for both prosecution and defense, though more frequently for prosecution in recent years.",
    "The document confirms the defense in the Epstein/Maxwell case was planning to call Elizabeth Loftus as an expert witness, which Goodman had 'surmised'.",
    "Goodman states she has not interviewed any victims in the Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell cases, and has only read about them in the press."
