    "The prosecution agreed to extend the motions schedule and provide Maxwell with a laptop at the MDC, but refused to agree to providing victim names and all 3500 material by the defense's demanded date.",
    "The correspondence is an internal prosecution email discussing strategy for formal communication with the presiding judge, Judge Nathan.",
    "The document references '3500 material,' which is likely a reference to Jencks Act or Rule 16 discovery material the prosecution must turn over to the defense."
