  "summary": "This is a federal district court opinion from the Southern District of New York in the defamation case of Virginia Giuffre against Alan Dershowitz. The court denies Dershowitz's motion to dismiss the defamation claim, finding the single publication rule does not bar it and Giuffre sufficiently pled malice to defeat a self-defense privilege. The court grants Dershowitz's motion to disqualify the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP from representing Giuffre, citing the advocate-witness rule as firm lawyers, including David Boies, are likely to be necessary witnesses on significant issues.",

    "The court ruled that New York's 'single publication rule' does not bar Giuffre's defamation claim because Dershowitz's 2018-2019 statements were affirmative republications intended for new audiences, not passive re-circulation.",
    "The court found Giuffre sufficiently alleged that Dershowitz acted with malice (knowledge of falsity), which defeats his claim to a qualified 'self-defense' privilege for his statements.",
    "The court disqualified the entire Boies Schiller Flexner law firm from representing Giuffre under the 'advocate-witness rule,' as firm lawyers (especially David Boies) are likely to be necessary witnesses on the central issue of whether Giuffre conspired with them to extort Dershowitz.",
    "The defamation claim is based on Dershowitz's statements calling Giuffre a liar, a perjurer, and claiming she conspired with her BSF lawyers to extort him and others (like Leslie Wexner).",
    "Dershowitz had brief, conflicted contact with BSF lawyers in 2015 where he shared a confidential memorandum, and he later recorded conversations with David Boies about Giuffre's allegations, which he plans to use as evidence."
