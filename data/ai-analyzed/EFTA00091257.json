    "In May 2020, prosecutors had recommended charging Ghislaine Maxwell but were debating the specific charges, requiring additional legal memos.",
    "Law enforcement considered Maxwell a significant flight risk and wanted to detain her to secure her passports and finances, but were concerned judges wouldn't jail her due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "The FBI ruled out physical surveillance at Maxwell's exclusive property in Manchester by the Sea to avoid tipping her off and was reluctant to involve local police for fear of leaks.",
    "Investigative actions in progress included re-upping subpoenas to Amazon, authorizing a mail cover, and preparing a pen register/trap and trace (pen/ping) for Maxwell's phone number once a warrant was secured.",
    "The correspondence reveals high-level decision-making above line assistants and internal coordination challenges between the FBI and the prosecutor's office regarding surveillance tactics."
