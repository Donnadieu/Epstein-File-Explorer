Preska denying Ghislaine Maxwell's request for reconsideration of the court's July 23, 2020 decision to unseal her deposition transcript and that of 'Doe 1'. The court rejects Maxwell's argument that her recent indictment and arrest constitute new grounds for keeping the depositions sealed, finding the issue was already considered. The order includes a brief stay to allow Maxwell to appeal.",

    "Judge Loretta A. Preska denied Ghislaine Maxwell's last-minute request to reconsider the unsealing of her deposition transcript and that of an anonymous witness (Doe 1).",
    "The court found Maxwell's argument—that her July 2020 indictment and arrest were new developments justifying secrecy—was not new, as the potential for her criminal liability was already implied in earlier filings.",
    "The court ordered a brief stay of the unsealing until August 3, 2020, solely to allow Maxwell time to seek an emergency stay from the Court of Appeals.",
    "The document references ongoing criminal investigations into individuals associated with Jeffrey Epstein, explicitly grouping Maxwell among them.",
    "The ruling reinforces the presumption of public access to court records, weighing it against Maxwell's concerns about influencing witnesses or victims."
