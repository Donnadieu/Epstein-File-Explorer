    "It argues that individuals with complex trauma histories are often misdiagnosed in forensic evaluations, potentially leading to unjust legal outcomes.",
    "The article emphasizes the need for multi-source, multi-measure corroboration in forensic assessments to avoid misinterpreting trauma symptoms as feigning or personality disorders.",
