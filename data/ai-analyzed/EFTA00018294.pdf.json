  "summary": "This is a memorandum and order from Judge Loretta A. Preska denying Ghislaine Maxwell's request for reconsideration of the court's decision to unseal her deposition transcript and that of 'Doe 1' in the civil case brought by Virginia Giuffre. The court rejects Maxwell's argument that her recent indictment and arrest constitute new grounds for keeping the depositions sealed, noting the issues were already considered, and imposes a brief stay to allow Maxwell to appeal.",

    "Maxwell argued her July 2020 indictment and arrest were new developments warranting secrecy, but the court ruled it had already considered the implications of potential criminal charges against her.",
    "The court imposed a short stay on unsealing the specific deposition transcripts until August 3, 2020, to allow Maxwell to seek an appeal.",
    "The document references ongoing criminal investigations into individuals associated with Jeffrey Epstein, a group that includes Maxwell.",
