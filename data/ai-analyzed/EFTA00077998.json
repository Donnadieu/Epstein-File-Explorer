    "The Virgin Islands civil complaint alleges Epstein's trustees (Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn) engaged in a conspiracy to conceal assets and the criminal activities of the 'Epstein Enterprise' even after his death.",
    "Southern Trust Company, a Virgin Islands entity, allegedly secured $73.6 million in tax exemptions between 2013-2017 by misrepresenting its business as 'biomedical and financial informatics' while actually employing personal staff and funding Epstein's criminal activities.",
    "Two days before his death, Epstein amended his trust and will, which the complaint alleges was part of a pattern to conceal and shield assets from potential claimants.",
    "The estate's proposed victims' compensation fund is opposed by the Virgin Islands AG because it imposes confidentiality and requires claimants to sacrifice other claims, which she argues conceals criminal activities and shields participants.",
    "The complaint indicates Southern Trust Company employed individuals who performed personal services for Epstein, including a driver/IT manager and a model living in a New York apartment Epstein's book listed as 'Apt. for models'."
