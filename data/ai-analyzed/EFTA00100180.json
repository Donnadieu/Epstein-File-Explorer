  "summary": "This is the prepared statement of David E. Patton, Executive Director of Federal Defenders of New York, for a House Judiciary Subcommittee oversight hearing on the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the implementation of the First Step Act. The testimony criticizes BOP management, citing the 2019 fire and power outage crisis at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn and the suicide of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan as examples of systemic failures. It raises concerns about the BOP's ability to faithfully implement the First Step Act, particularly regarding programming, the PATTERN risk assessment tool, and the closure of Residential Reentry Centers. A letter from the Federal Public Defender for the Western District of Washington to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, detailing systemic Bureau practices that are causing the closure and financial endangerment of reentry centers (halfway houses) across the United States. The letter argues these practices contradict Congressional mandates like the Second Chance Act and the First Step Act, and urges immediate corrective action. This document is a letter from Federal Public Defender Thomas W. Hillier II to the Acting Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Thomas R. Kane, providing formal comment on proposed regulations implementing the Second Chance Act's pre-release community confinement provisions. The letter argues the BOP's proposed regulation fails to comply with congressional mandates, criticizes an informal six-month limit on community corrections, and advocates for a presumption of maximum allowable community placement to promote successful reentry and save taxpayer money. An attachment lists Residential Reentry Center contracts expiring or not being renewed. This document is a compilation of news articles and a government memorandum concerning the Federal Bureau of Prisons' decision to end contracts with 16 halfway houses (Residential Reentry Centers) in 2017. It details the policy's impact, reactions from judges, advocates, and contractors, and includes a related 2019 solicitation for services in Oklahoma. The document highlights a shift in criminal justice policy under Attorney General Jeff Sessions. This document is a cover letter and the 2018 annual report from the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to Congress, as required by the Second Chance Act, detailing the BOP's use of Residential Reentry Centers (RRCs) and home confinement services. It provides statistical data on inmate eligibility and placement from April 2017 through March 2018, and outlines recent activities and future goals for community corrections.",
