    "The term 'grooming' in the context of child sexual exploitation originated among a group of law enforcement investigators in the late 1970s to describe a seduction pattern of offender behavior.",
    "The concept emerged with the growing recognition of extrafamilial acquaintance offenders in the 1980s, as law enforcement moved beyond focusing solely on 'stranger danger' and intrafamilial abuse.",
    "Early literature and experts like Nicholas Groth (1979) described the process, but Jon Conte's 1984 article is noted as potentially the first to name it 'grooming' in publication.",
    "Kenneth Lanning, the author, first used the term 'grooming' in writing in a 1989 NCMEC publication, though he personally prefers the term 'seduction' for its clarity.",
    "The article clarifies that grooming/seduction refers to specific nonviolent techniques (attention, affection, gifts, privileges) used to gain access and control, and is generally incompatible with the use of force or threats.",
    "The article defines grooming as a non-violent process used by sex offenders to access and control child victims, which can itself constitute sexual gratification and be a sex offense.",
    "It argues that child victims should be considered victims under the law simply due to their age and developmental immaturity, regardless of whether force, threats, or violence were used.",
    "The document highlights the difficulty for youth-serving organizations in distinguishing grooming behavior from legitimate mentoring activities.",
    "It references multiple FBI-sponsored seminars and law enforcement publications on child sexual exploitation dating from the 1980s, indicating long-standing institutional focus on the issue.",
    "Author Kenneth Lanning is identified as a former FBI special agent with over 30 years of experience, specializing in behavioral analysis of crimes against children."
