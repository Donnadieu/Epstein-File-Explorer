    "A suicide prevention training was conducted at MCC New York on December 7, 2018, for staff managing the Special Housing Unit (SHU).",
    "Training materials state that 30-80% of inmate suicides in the BOP occur on locked units like SHUs, and single cells in these units are especially risky.",
    "High-risk inmate groups identified include the mentally ill, behavior disordered inmates, sex offenders, and protective custody inmates.",
    "The training recommended double-celling inmates in SHUs to reduce isolation and suicide risk, unless a compelling reason exists for single-celling.",
    "The materials reference a 'Psychology Advisory List' (TRU-SCOPE) and 'PSY Alert' system to track inmates with mental health conditions who may become dangerous or suicidal in the SHU."
