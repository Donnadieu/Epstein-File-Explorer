    "The interview focuses on a SigNet service request from August 8-10, 2019, for a failed video system RAID array at the MCC, where Jeffrey Epstein died.",
    "The former SigNet employee states the FBI confiscated the video recording equipment on August 10th while drives were being rebuilt, which could have corrupted any remaining video data.",
    "Technical discussion indicates that if two drives in a RAID 5 array failed (as was the case), all data would be lost and the array would need to be completely rebuilt.",
    "The interviewee suggests the MCC contact was following SigNet's instructions for the rebuild and implies the FBI's seizure during the process may have contributed to data loss.",
    "The document is part of the DOJ OIG's investigation into the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death, specifically examining potential evidence preservation issues with the MCC's video surveillance system."
