    "The defense contends Maxwell's previous actions to maintain privacy (using a trust, pseudonym) were for protection from harassment, not indicative of flight risk.",
    "A COVID-19 surge at the MDC with 113 cases and potential suspension of legal calls/visits is cited as further justification for bail to protect Maxwell's health and right to counsel."
