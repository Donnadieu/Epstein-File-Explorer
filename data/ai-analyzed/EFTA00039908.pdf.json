  "summary": "This is a declaration by Russell Capone, an Assistant United States Attorney, filed in support of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' motion for summary judgment in a FOIA lawsuit brought by The New York Times. The declaration argues for withholding records related to Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration and death at the Metropolitan Correctional Center under FOIA Exemption 7(A), citing potential interference with the pending prosecutions of correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, and inmate Nicholas Tartaglione. This appears to be a declaration page from a court filing in a civil case (Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE), executed on August 5, 2020. The declarant attests under penalty of perjury that the preceding statements are true and correct. This is a federal indictment against correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas for conspiracy and making false records. It alleges they failed to perform mandated inmate counts and rounds in the Special Housing Unit (SHU) of the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) on August 9-10, 2019, falsified logs to cover this up, and that during this period of neglect, inmate Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide. This is a superseding indictment from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Nicholas Tartaglione. It charges him with 15 counts related to a narcotics conspiracy, multiple murders, kidnapping, and firearms offenses stemming from events in April 2016, including the killings of four men at or near the Likquid Lounge and 419 Old Mountain Road. This document is a superseding indictment from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, detailing multiple counts against defendant Nicholas Tartaglione. It charges him with crimes including murder, kidnapping, and drug trafficking related to the deaths of four individuals—Martin Luna, Urbano Santiago, Miguel Luna, and Hector Gutierrez—on or about April 11, 2016. The document includes special findings that detail the aggravating factors for potential capital punishment.",
