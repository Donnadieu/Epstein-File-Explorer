  "summary": "This is a declaration by Russell Capone, an Assistant United States Attorney, filed in support of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' motion for summary judgment in a FOIA lawsuit brought by The New York Times. The declaration argues for withholding records related to Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration and death at the Metropolitan Correctional Center under FOIA Exemption 7(A), citing likely interference with the pending prosecutions of correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, and inmate Nicholas Tartaglione. This appears to be a declaration or affidavit executed on August 5, 2020, as part of a court filing (Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22-1). It is a sworn statement made under penalty of perjury, certifying the truth of the preceding content. This is a federal indictment against correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas for conspiracy and making false records. It alleges they failed to perform mandated inmate counts and rounds in the Metropolitan Correctional Center's Special Housing Unit on August 9-10, 2019, falsified records to cover their dereliction, and that their negligence allowed Jeffrey Epstein to commit suicide while unobserved. This is a superseding indictment from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Nicholas Tartaglione. It charges him with 15 counts related to a narcotics conspiracy, multiple murders, kidnapping, and firearms offenses stemming from events in April 2016, including the killings of four men at or near the Likquid Lounge and 419 Old Mountain Road. This document is a superseding indictment from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charging defendant Nicholas Tartaglione with multiple counts related to a drug trafficking enterprise, kidnapping, and murder. It details the killings of four individuals—Martin Luna, Urbano Santiago, Miguel Luna, and Hector Gutierrez—on or about April 11, 2016, and includes special findings for potential capital punishment.",
