  "summary": "This is a declaration by Russell Capone, an Assistant United States Attorney, filed in support of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' motion for summary judgment in a FOIA lawsuit brought by The New York Times. The declaration argues for withholding records related to Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration and death under FOIA Exemption 7(A), citing potential interference with the pending criminal prosecutions of correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, and inmate Nicholas Tartaglione. This appears to be a declaration page from a court filing in a civil case (Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE), executed on August 5, 2020. The declarant attests under penalty of perjury that the preceding statements are true and correct. This is a federal indictment against correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas for conspiracy and making false records. It alleges they failed to perform mandated inmate counts and rounds at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) on August 9-10, 2019, falsified records to cover their dereliction, and that their failure to monitor the Special Housing Unit allowed Jeffrey Epstein to commit suicide while unobserved. This is a superseding indictment from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Nicholas Tartaglione. It charges him with 15 counts related to a narcotics conspiracy, multiple murders, kidnapping, and firearms offenses stemming from events in April 2016, including the killings of four men at or near the Likquid Lounge and 419 Old Mountain Road. This document is a superseding indictment from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charging defendant Nicholas Tartaglione with multiple counts related to a drug trafficking enterprise and the murders of four individuals (Martin Luna, Urbano Santiago, Miguel Luna, and Hector Gutierrez) in April 2016. It details the charges, including kidnapping resulting in death and murder in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, and includes special findings for potential capital punishment.",

    "The document is a legal declaration arguing for the withholding of BOP records on Epstein's incarceration to prevent interference with the pending prosecutions of correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, and inmate Nicholas Tartaglione.",
    "It confirms that Nicholas Tartaglione was Jeffrey Epstein's cellmate in the MCC's Special Housing Unit on July 23, 2019, the date of Epstein's first apparent suicide attempt.",
    "The declaration details two specific incidents: Epstein's July 23, 2019, suicide attempt and his death by suicide on August 10, 2019, while in BOP custody.",
    "It states that the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York City determined Epstein's death was a suicide by hanging.",
    "The document highlights that the defense in the Tartaglione case has put the conditions of his confinement and his interactions with Epstein at issue, potentially for the penalty phase of his trial.",
    "This document is a sworn declaration executed on August 5, 2020.",

    "The defendants falsified count slips for the 4 p.m., 10 p.m., 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. institutional counts, and Noel falsified over 75 entries for 30-minute rounds, leading the MCC to believe inmates were being monitored.",
    "Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in his cell at approximately 6:33 a.m. on August 10, having committed suicide by hanging while unobserved due to the officers' failure to perform their duties.",
    "Epstein had been placed in the SHU due to risk factors for suicidality and, after a prior apparent suicide attempt on July 23, 2019, was supposed to have a cellmate, but was alone on the night of his death because his cellmate was transferred and not replaced.",
