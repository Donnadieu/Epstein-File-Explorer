  "summary": "This document contains due diligence research results for Erika Kellerhals, including various searches for negative media, public records, and personal information. It highlights the absence of significant negative findings and provides details about her personal and professional affiliations. This document discusses a turnover action involving James P. Carroll, the Chapter 7 trustee for the bankruptcy estate of Jeffrey Prosser, who seeks to recover fraudulent transfers made to his wife, Dawn Prosser. The court reviews motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial, ultimately denying both motions and affirming the jury's verdict in favor of Trustee Carroll. This document details the proceedings of a divorce case involving Julito A. Francis and Dr. Debra Wright-Francis, focusing on the equitable distribution of their marital property. The court addressed various motions and stipulations regarding the division of assets, including the marital homestead and personal property, as well as the financial circumstances of both parties. This document details the procedural history and court rulings regarding the divorce proceedings between Julito Francis and Dr. Wright-Francis. It outlines various motions filed by both parties concerning custody, visitation, and the division of marital assets, including financial disputes and the valuation of their marital homestead. This document discusses the equitable distribution of marital property in the divorce proceedings between Mr. Francis and Dr. Wright-Francis. It addresses the division of retirement accounts and the status of Dr. Wright-Francis' medical degree as marital property, ultimately concluding that both parties are entitled to retain their respective retirement accounts and that Dr. Wright-Francis' medical degree is her separate property.",
