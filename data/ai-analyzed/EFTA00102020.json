  "keyFacts": [
    "The court denied Ghislaine Maxwell's request for a broad exception to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who had made any public statement 'relating to' her or Jeffrey Epstein, finding the request too broad and a risk to privacy protections.",
    "The court adopted the Government's narrower language, allowing Maxwell to publicly reference only individuals who have spoken by name on the record in *this* specific criminal case.",
    "The court denied Maxwell's unprecedented request to restrict potential Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for this criminal trial.",
    "The ruling emphasizes the strong interest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses, even if they have made past public statements.",
    "The document is a formal court order (Docket No. 37) that resolves the motion for a protective order (Docket No. 29)."
