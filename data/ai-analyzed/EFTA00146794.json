    "Media reporting was heavily focused on Ghislaine Maxwell's role, but the investigative team was prioritizing charges for a different, unnamed co-conspirator at that time.",
    "The FBI was actively conducting interviews (e.g., of 14 MCC Corrections Officers) and financial analysis, and was focused on analyzing seized phones to determine the nature and timing of future charges.",
    "A separate drug/sex case involving individuals referred to as C-19 and C-2 was mentioned as being closely related, with coordination advised.",
    "An upcoming court hearing on the Tuesday following the email was a major focus, with preparations involving victim coordination and transportation."
