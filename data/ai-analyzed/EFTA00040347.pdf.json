    "Ghislaine Maxwell is held in de facto solitary confinement at the MDC, described as conditions rivaling those for death row inmates, despite being a non-violent defendant.",
    "The defense argues the harsh conditions are a punitive overreaction by the BOP to the suicide of Jeffrey Epstein, aimed at repairing the BOP's reputation, not based on any specific threat from Maxwell.",
    "Maxwell has suffered significant physical effects from her detention, including weight loss of 15-20 pounds, hair loss (telogen effluvium), and sleep deprivation from 15-minute flashlight checks.",
    "Her ability to prepare her defense is severely compromised by restrictions on legal communication, including deleted legal emails, failed video conferences, and intrusive surveillance during attorney-client meetings.",
    "The MDC is experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak with around 80 inmates testing positive, and Maxwell was quarantined after contact with a security team member who tested positive."
