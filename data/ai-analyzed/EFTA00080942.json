    "Victims of Jeffrey Epstein were requesting formal notification letters from the FBI to apply for the victim compensation fund.",
    "The FBI was hesitant to provide standard letters because not all interviewed individuals necessarily met the legal definition of a victim of a federal crime, despite being negatively affected by Epstein.",
    "The investigation was still active at the time of this correspondence (July 2020), preventing the release of FBI interview reports (302s).",
    "Law enforcement personnel were coordinating internally to determine how to appropriately assist all affected individuals while adhering to legal protocols."
