  "summary": "This is a court opinion and order by Judge Alison J. Nathan regarding the defense's motion to exclude the government's expert witness, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, in the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal case. The court largely denies the motion, allowing Dr. Rocchio to testify about grooming, trauma, and victim behavior in child sexual abuse cases, but excludes one specific opinion about 'grooming-by-proxy'.",

    "The court ruled that Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert on child sexual abuse trauma and grooming, is qualified and her testimony is largely admissible in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial.",
    "Dr. Rocchio's admissible opinions include: perpetrators use grooming/manipulation; grooming can prevent victims from understanding/disclosing abuse; abuse causes long-term trauma; nondisclosure and memory issues are common among victims.",
    "The court excluded one specific opinion: that the presence of a third party can facilitate grooming ('grooming-by-proxy'), finding it was not supported by peer-reviewed literature.",
    "The defense's motion argued Rocchio's methods were unreliable due to lack of error rates and reliance on patient reports, but the court found these objections misplaced in the field of clinical psychology studying sexual abuse.",
    "The opinion cites numerous other federal court cases that have admitted similar expert testimony on grooming and trauma in cases involving sexual exploitation of minors."
