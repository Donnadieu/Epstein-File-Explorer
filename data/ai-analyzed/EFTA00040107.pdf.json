  "summary": "This is a court opinion and order by Judge Alison J. Nathan regarding the defense's motion to exclude the government's expert witness, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, in the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal case. The court largely denies the motion, allowing Dr. Rocchio to testify about grooming, trauma, and victim behavior in child sexual abuse cases, but excludes one specific opinion about 'grooming-by-proxy'.",

    "The court ruled that Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert on child sexual abuse trauma and grooming, is qualified and her testimony is largely admissible in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial.",
    "The court excluded one specific opinion from Dr. Rocchio: that the presence of a third party can facilitate grooming (termed 'grooming-by-proxy'), finding it lacked sufficient support in academic literature.",
    "Dr. Rocchio's admissible opinions include: how grooming works without physical force, why victims may not immediately disclose abuse, long-term psychological consequences of abuse, and why disclosure may be delayed or incremental.",
    "The defense argued Rocchio's methods were unreliable because they were based on patient reports and lacked an error rate, but the court found these objections misplaced in the field of clinical psychology studying sexual abuse.",
    "The government alleges Ghislaine Maxwell both participated in sexual abuse of minors and conspired with Jeffrey Epstein, who groomed and abused minors."
