  "summary": "This is a court opinion and order by Judge Alison J. Nathan regarding the defense's motion to exclude the government's expert witness, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, in the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal case. The court largely denies the motion, allowing Dr. Rocchio to testify about grooming, trauma, and victim behavior in child sexual abuse cases, but excludes one specific opinion about 'grooming-by-proxy'.",

    "The court ruled that Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert on child sexual abuse trauma, is qualified and her testimony on grooming and victim behavior is admissible under the Daubert standard.",
    "The court excluded one specific opinion from Dr. Rocchio: that the presence of a third party can facilitate grooming ('grooming-by-proxy'), finding it lacked sufficient support in the relevant literature.",
    "Dr. Rocchio's admissible testimony will cover how perpetrators use grooming/manipulation, why victims may not immediately disclose abuse, the long-term psychological consequences of abuse, and how memory can be affected by trauma.",
    "The defense's motion to exclude the testimony was largely denied, allowing the prosecution to use this expert testimony to explain victim behavior and counter anticipated defense impeachment strategies."
