    "Ghislaine Maxwell's niece, Matilda Munro, wrote a personal plea to Judge Nathan for Maxwell's bail, arguing her detention conditions are 'inhumane and degrading'.",
    "The letter alleges Maxwell was not being fed properly, denied access to glasses to read, and that most letters written to her were being sent back.",
    "Maxwell had been in solitary confinement since July 2020, with the potential for it to continue until July 2021, which the author argues jeopardizes her ability to prepare a defense.",
    "The author argues Maxwell poses no danger to the public, had prior opportunity to flee the U.S. before her arrest and did not, and should be granted bail with technological monitoring.",
    "The letter draws a parallel to the UK trial of Maxwell's brother, Kevin, in the 1990s, where he was granted bail and allowed to work and travel before his trial."
