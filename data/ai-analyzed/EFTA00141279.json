    "The OIG's final report, dated June 26, 2023, contained eight specific recommendations for the BOP regarding inmate custody procedures, largely prompted by the case of Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "All eight recommendations are currently marked as 'Resolved' by the OIG based on the BOP's September 11, 2023, status update describing planned or ongoing actions.",
    "The recommendations focus on critical procedural gaps, including assigning cellmates after suicide watch, ensuring high-risk inmates have cellmates, visit approval processes, inmate accountability methods, lieutenant round requirements, staffing shortages, cell search procedures, and security camera functionality.",
    "The BOP reported it is developing new guidance (a 'CEO memo') in collaboration between its Reentry Services Division and Correctional Programs Division to address housing and cellmate assignment procedures following suicide watch.",
    "The BOP is actively implementing recruitment and retention incentives, including a $10,000 or 25% salary recruitment bonus for new Correctional Officers, to address staffing shortages."
