  "keyFacts": [
    "On August 9, 2019, the day before Epstein's death, the MCC's camera recording system failed. Approximately 50-60 cameras, including all but one camera in the SHU, were not recording due to old, failing hard drives.",
    "The electronics technician discovered the failure around 1:00-2:00 PM on August 9th, verbally notified a supervisor, and was approved for overtime to fix it the next morning (August 10th). He states this was standard practice at the MCC, unlike at his previous institutions.",
    "The only SHU camera recording on the night of August 9-10 was the \"46-door\" camera outside of 10 South. The footage was described as grainy. All other SHU cameras had a live feed but were not recording.",
    "The witness responded to the body alarm on the morning of August 10th and assisted with chest compressions. He later returned to the SHU to help settle inmates, who were yelling at officers Noel and Thomas, claiming \"you killed him\" and \"you didn't do rounds.\"",
    "The witness believes Epstein's death was a suicide and a coincidence that it occurred when the cameras were down. He stated the system was old, failure was a known and recurring problem, and he saw no evidence of tampering."
