    "The judge grants the government's motion to allow eight individuals (witnesses and alleged victims) to be referred to by pseudonyms or first names during the trial to protect their privacy and prevent harassment.",
    "The judge rules that the government may use the term 'victim' during trial, finding it is not inherently prejudicial and any potential prejudice can be cured by jury instructions on the presumption of innocence.",
    "The defense is already aware of the true identities of all eight individuals, and the jury will also be made aware; the pseudonyms are only for use in open court.",
    "The judge orders the parties to submit a joint proposal by November 10 for the pseudonyms to be used and for a limiting instruction to the jury explaining the reason for the privacy precautions.",
    "The judge emphasizes that the defense's right to cross-examine witnesses will not be unduly limited, though specific identifying information (like employer names, family member names, addresses) should not be elicited."
