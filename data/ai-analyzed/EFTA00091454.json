    "Evidence indicates Epstein's abuse of minors started earlier than previously charged (as early as 1994) and that Ghislaine Maxwell participated in facilitating and engaging in that abuse, including with Minor Victim-1.",
    "After the initial search of the New York residence, an employee removed contents from a safe into suitcases at the direction of a third party; these were later recovered by the FBI, showing attempts to remove potential evidence.",
    "Communications extracted from seized devices show Maxwell discussing with others the recruitment of 'young women' or 'girls' for Epstein and other individuals, indicating a broader network."
