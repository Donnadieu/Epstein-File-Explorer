  "summary": "This document is an email chain from June 2020 between personnel from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (USANYS) and FBI NY CART (Computer Analysis and Response Team) examiners. The emails discuss significant delays and logistical challenges in processing, transferring, and reviewing digital evidence seized from Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The correspondence reveals frustration over the inability to access and search the data, concerns about meeting discovery obligations, and the massive scale of the evidence (terabytes of data from numerous devices).",

    "The FBI's Computer Analysis and Response Team (CART) was processing terabytes of digital evidence seized from Jeffrey Epstein's New York and U.S. Virgin Islands residences, including servers, laptops, phones, tablets, DVRs, and numerous loose storage devices.",
    "Significant delays were caused by staffing reductions (down to one day a week in the office), the complexity of the data, and methodological disagreements over using the Relativity e-discovery tool for forensic review.",
    "The U.S. Attorney's Office reported critical failures in earlier data transfers, receiving over 1 million documents in an unusable format where emails could not be linked to attachments and many files were inaccessible.",
    "Investigators were seeking to obtain results from searches conducted in July and September (presumably 2019) before moving forward with possible additional charges in the case.",
    "The evidence inventory included multiple copies of hard drives from a July 2007 search of one of Epstein's properties, indicating a long history of digital evidence collection."
