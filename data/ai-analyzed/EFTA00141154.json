    "The interviewed BOP Captain stated that Jeffrey Epstein engaged in manipulative behavior to avoid having a cellmate, including requesting to see a psychologist, which led to him being placed on Suicide Watch and later Psychological Observation.",
    "Despite a clear directive from the Warden that Epstein was to have a cellmate at all times, on August 9, 2019, Epstein's cellmate Efrain Reyes went to court and his belongings were removed from the cell, leaving Epstein alone. The Captain was not notified of this.",
    "On the morning of August 10, 2019, staff admitted to not completing the required 30-minute rounds on Epstein's cell and failing to perform the 3:00 AM and 5:00 AM inmate counts.",
    "The camera surveillance system in the Special Housing Unit (SHU) was reportedly down around the time of Epstein's death, and the Captain was not aware of the extent of the malfunction until he arrived on the morning of August 10th.",
    "The Captain emphasized that he and his staff did their best to supervise Epstein, but the document reveals multiple procedural failures: informal communication of critical orders, lack of notification about cellmate removal, and failure to complete security rounds and counts."
