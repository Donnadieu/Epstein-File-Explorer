    "Forensic analysis was performed on hard drives designated as GX 54 and GX 55, which were identified as Dell computers.",
    "Several Word documents (GX 417, 418, 420, 421, 422) were examined; GX 417 was found at the root of the C drive, an unusual location suggesting an attempt to hide it or make it easily accessible to another user.",
    "Documents GX 418, 420, 421, and 422 were saved under Ghislaine Maxwell's user profile on the examined drive.",
    "The testimony explains how document metadata (creation date, author, last printed) is generated and can be manipulated, such as a 'last printed' date occurring before a 'created' date if a document is printed and then saved with 'Save As'.",
    "Emails (GX 412 and GX 415) were also confirmed to be on the hard drive GX 54."
