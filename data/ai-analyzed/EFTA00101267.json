    "Dr. stated that Epstein's attorneys never contacted Psychological Services with any mental health concerns, and they did not inform staff when Epstein signed a new will on August 8, which would have been a major red flag.",
    "Dr. emphasized the importance of housing SHU inmates with a cellmate to decrease isolation, provide a distraction, and offer a rescue opportunity, noting that lack of a cellmate and understaffing contributed to Epstein's death.",
    "The document reveals that regular rounds by correctional officers in the SHU were not being completed, a fact Dr. was unaware of because, as executive staff, officers would not tell her and inmates feared retaliation."
