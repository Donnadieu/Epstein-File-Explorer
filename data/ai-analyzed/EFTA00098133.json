  "summary": "This is a motion filed by the co-executors of Jeffrey Epstein's estate in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, requesting expedited approval to establish a voluntary claims resolution program (the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program) to address sexual abuse claims against Epstein. The motion outlines the proposed program's structure, administration by independent experts, and argues it is in the best interests of claimants and the estate to avoid protracted litigation. This document is a court filing and subsequent order from the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands regarding the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein. The Co-Executors of the estate filed an expedited motion to establish a Voluntary Claims Resolution Program, which the court granted. The order directs the Co-Executors to submit the proposed engagement agreement for the Program Administrator and Designers under seal for court approval.",
