  "summary": "This is a court order by Judge Alison J. Nathan granting a short continuance of Ghislaine Maxwell's trial from July 2021 to fall 2021. The continuance is granted due to the government's late filing of an S2 Superseding Indictment, which added new charges and an alleged victim, requiring additional defense preparation time. The order balances the defense's need to prepare against the interests of the defendant, victims, and the public in a timely trial.",

  "keyFacts": [
    "The S2 Superseding Indictment extended the timeframe of the charged conspiracies from through 1997 to 2004 and identified a fourth alleged victim, referred to as Minor Victim-4.",
    "The S2 Indictment added two new charges: Count 5 (sex trafficking conspiracy, 2001-2004) and Count 6 (sex trafficking of a minor or aiding and abetting).",
    "The court granted a continuance primarily due to the significant new burden on the defense from the S2 indictment, requiring review of new discovery, re-review of old discovery, new investigations, and revised trial strategy.",
    "The court rejected longer continuance requests (to January or March 2022) and ordered the parties to propose an early fall 2021 trial date, balancing defense preparation needs against the public interest in a timely trial.",
    "The order notes that Maxwell's trial preparation, and the government's investigation, had been hampered by travel constraints and safety concerns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic."
