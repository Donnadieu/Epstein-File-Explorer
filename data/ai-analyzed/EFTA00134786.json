  "summary": "A series of Bureau of Prisons psychology service records documenting clinical contacts, suicide risk assessments, and a disciplinary competency evaluation for inmate Jeffrey Epstein from July 27 to August 1, 2019, while he was held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York (MCC-NY). The records detail his mental status, complaints about conditions in the Special Housing Unit (SHU), an incident involving marks on his neck, and his eventual return to SHU housing. This document contains two Bureau of Prisons mental health clinical intervention reports for inmate Jeffrey Epstein, dated August 1 and August 8, 2019. The reports assess his suicide risk and mental status while housed in the Special Housing Unit (SHU) at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York (NYM). The August 1 report details a prior incident on July 23, 2019, where he was found with a string around his neck, and concludes his acute suicide risk is low.",
