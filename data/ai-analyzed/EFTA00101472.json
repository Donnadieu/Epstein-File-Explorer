    "Prosecutors referenced a prior non-prosecution agreement from S.D. Fla. as a reason for not stepping into that district's shoes.",
    "Internal discussions show coordination between criminal and civil divisions on handling victim requests while protecting ongoing investigations and grand jury materials."
