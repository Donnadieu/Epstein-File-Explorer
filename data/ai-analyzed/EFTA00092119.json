    "An unnamed client represented by UK law firm Blackfords LLP is willing to provide a confidential witness statement regarding Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, but only if questions are limited to the 1994-1997 period of the Maxwell indictment.",
    "The U.S. prosecution has designated this client as a 'subject' of the investigation, not merely a witness, which raised concerns for his lawyers and led to the proposal of a written statement as a compromise.",
    "The client's lawyers propose a process where he would first provide a witness statement and then answer written follow-up questions, a common UK practice, with strict confidentiality guarantees requested.",
    "The correspondence reveals ongoing negotiations between UK lawyers and U.S. prosecutors in 2020 regarding obtaining evidence from a potentially significant associate of Maxwell and Epstein.",
    "The document references mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) protections and U.S. case law (Kastigar v. United States) regarding the use of compelled testimony, indicating the legal complexity of the cooperation."
