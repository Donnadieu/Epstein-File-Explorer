    "The witness states that allowing an inmate to make an unmonitored personal call on a legal line was against BOP policy and a security risk, as it could not be reviewed for threats or witness intimidation.",
    "There are discrepancies in the timeline: the witness is confident he reported the camera failure to the Captain on August 8th, but the Captain stated he wasn't told until August 10th, and the witness's own memo was dated August 10th.",
    "The interview reveals standard BOP emergency procedures, including that hitting a 'body alarm' should trigger a response from all available staff within 2-3 minutes, and such events are logged in a control officer logbook."
