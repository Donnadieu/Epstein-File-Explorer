    "The document is an email chain dated July 24, 2019, discussing clinical responsibilities regarding an inmate.",
    "The inmate is directly named as Epstein, and the context involves his reported suicidality and an incident report while on Special Watch (SW).",
    "A psychologist is described as avoiding writing a disciplinary/competency report for Epstein, fearing she would 'get torn up on the stand and lose her license' if called to testify.",
    "The discussion criticizes the psychologist's inefficiency and avoidance of her job, describing it as 'poor leadership'.",
    "The emails suggest a process where a disciplinary report is needed because Epstein received an incident report while on SW or went to SW right after an incident."
