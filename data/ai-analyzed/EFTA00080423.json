    "The government produced 987 pages of BOP records related to Jeffrey Epstein in response to a FOIA lawsuit by The New York Times, including 377 pages of non-email documents and 610 pages of emails.",
    "Many of the withheld emails involve communications between the BOP and defense attorney Bruce Barket regarding his client, inmate Nicholas Tartaglione, and were captured because Barket's firm name includes 'Epstein' in its signature.",
    "The government argues these Tartaglione-related emails are likely non-responsive to the Times's FOIA request for Jeffrey Epstein records but were collected due to broad electronic search terms.",
    "The document details a complex system of color-coded highlights and markings used to indicate which FOIA exemptions (7(A), 6, 7(C), 5, 7(E)) apply to each redaction.",
    "The production was re-ordered and had duplicates removed to facilitate court review, resulting in Bates numbers that are no longer in strict sequential order."
