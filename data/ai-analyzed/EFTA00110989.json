  "keyFacts": [
    "The lieutenant confirms Epstein was required to have a cellmate for three reasons: 1) He was in the SHU (where inmates are generally double-bunked), 2) He was on the 'hot list' due to his suicide attempt, and 3) An email was sent on July 30, 2019, stating he needed a cellmate after coming off suicide watch.",
    "The lieutenant states that rounds and counts in the SHU on August 9-10, 2019, appear to have been falsified or not properly conducted, based on discrepancies in count slips and Els shown during the interview.",
    "The lieutenant believes Epstein's death was primarily due to failure to conduct proper 30-minute rounds and counts, not solely the lack of a cellmate, though both were factors.",
    "The lieutenant had personal interaction with Epstein when he was on suicide watch, taking him to showers and speaking with him about why he was there.",
    "The interview reveals systemic issues at MCC including severe understaffing, mandated overtime, and difficulties in hiring and retention, which the lieutenant suggests contributed to operational failures."
