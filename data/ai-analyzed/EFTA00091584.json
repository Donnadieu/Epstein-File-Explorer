    "Correctional officers Michael Thomas and Tova Noel are criminally charged for falsifying inmate count logs on the night Jeffrey Epstein died in his MCC cell.",
    "The court order denies Thomas's motion to compel production of the DOJ Inspector General's report on Epstein's death, as the report was not yet completed and the government stated it had already provided all related investigatory materials.",
    "The court found the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) was not part of the 'prosecution team' for this criminal case, so the government was not obligated to turn over BOP internal investigative materials.",
    "The government had already produced extensive discovery including surveillance video, count slips, staffing records, phone records, employee files, and witness statements from the investigation.",
    "Thomas's motion argued for discovery to support a defense that falsifying count slips was widespread and tolerated by BOP leadership, but the court found he provided no evidence to meet the legal standard for such a claim."
