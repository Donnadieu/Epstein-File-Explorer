  "summary": "This is a transcript of oral arguments before Judge Paul A. Engelmayer in the FOIA case The New York Times Company v. Federal Bureau of Prisons. The arguments focus on the government's use of FOIA Exemption 7(A) to withhold documents related to Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration and death, citing potential interference with the pending criminal prosecutions of BOP officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, and the capital case of inmate Nicholas Tartaglione. The judge expresses skepticism about the breadth of the withholdings and indicates he will likely conduct an in-camera review.",
