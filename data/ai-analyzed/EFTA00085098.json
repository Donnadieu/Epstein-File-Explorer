  "summary": "This is a Second Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in the case Brown v. Maxwell, addressing appeals from orders denying motions to unseal documents in a defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre against Ghislaine Maxwell. The court vacates the district court's sealing orders, mandates the unsealing of the summary judgment record with minimal redactions, and remands for individualized review of remaining sealed discovery materials. The opinion discusses the strong presumption of public access to judicial documents and cautions about the reliability of allegations in court filings.",
