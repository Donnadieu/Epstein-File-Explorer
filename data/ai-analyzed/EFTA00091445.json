The meeting is a requirement of the DOJ's settlement in the CVRA (Crime Victims' Rights Act) litigation, intended to present the findings of an OPR (Office of Professional Responsibility) investigation. The emails focus on updating victim contact lists and logistical planning to avoid substantive discussions of victims' experiences during the main meeting.",
