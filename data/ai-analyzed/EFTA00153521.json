  "summary": "This is an email chain from January 28, 2020, discussing United Airlines flight records. The correspondence indicates there were only two flight records found: one for an unspecified individual in January 2020 and one for another unspecified individual booked by the DOJ in August 2019. No records were found for Ghislaine Maxwell. The emails show prosecutors struggling to interpret the records and considering calling a custodian witness to explain them to a grand jury.",
