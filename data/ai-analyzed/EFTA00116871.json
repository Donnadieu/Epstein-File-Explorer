    "The interviewed BOP Lieutenant was the operations lieutenant on the morning watch shift from approximately 10:00 p.m. on August 9, 2019, to around 6:00 a.m. on August 10, 2019, when Epstein was found deceased.",
    "A major point of contention is the lieutenant's involvement in correcting inmate count logs related to inmate Fernandez, who was physically in R&D but still counted in the SHU, creating discrepancies in the 10:00 p.m. and midnight counts.",
    "The lieutenant repeatedly states she was unaware that Jeffrey Epstein was required to have a cellmate after coming off suicide watch and was unaware his cellmate, Reyes, had been transferred out, despite an alleged email from psychology staff.",
    "The lieutenant certified conducting a round in the SHU at 5:21 a.m. on August 10 but describes this as \"visiting\" the unit and talking to staff, not physically checking on each inmate in their cells, which she states was not a formal requirement at the time.",
    "The interview reveals significant staffing shortages and officer fatigue at MCC during this period, with officers being mandated for overtime frequently, which the lieutenant cites as a contributing factor to operational challenges."
