  "summary": "This is a legal memorandum filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team in support of a motion for individual sequestered juror voir dire and limited attorney-conducted voir dire. The document argues that intense negative pretrial publicity and the sensitive nature of the charges necessitate these special jury selection procedures to ensure a fair trial. This is a legal motion filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense attorneys requesting that the court allow attorney-conducted voir dire (jury selection questioning) in addition to court-conducted questioning. The motion argues that extensive pretrial publicity and the sensitive nature of the charges necessitate a more thorough, individualized examination of potential jurors to uncover bias and ensure a fair trial.",
