    "The video was mistakenly not preserved because the MCC computer system listed an incorrect cell number for Epstein's cellmate, leading staff to preserve unrelated footage.",
    "The Assistant US Attorneys and investigative team had been aware of the video corruption issue since November 2019.",
    "The disclosure of the missing video was likely to revive conspiracy theories suggesting Epstein was murdered to prevent him from discussing his activities.",
    "The internal FBI correspondence is dated January 10, 2020, and discusses validating reports about the alleged missing video."
