Alexander Acosta to Jeffrey Epstein's attorneys, Jack Goldberger and Roy Black, expressing frustration that the U.S. Attorney's Office has not received a copy of Epstein's proposed state plea agreement or notice of his change of plea hearing, despite deadlines in a Non-Prosecution Agreement. The letter demands the documents by that afternoon and warns that failure to comply will be considered a breach, indicating tensions over the implementation of Epstein's controversial plea deal.",
