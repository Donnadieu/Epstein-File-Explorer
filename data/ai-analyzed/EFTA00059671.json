  "summary": "This is a DOJ OIG interview transcript of a Federal Bureau of Prisons Lieutenant who was the Special Housing Unit (SHU) Lieutenant at MCC New York during the period leading up to Jeffrey Epstein's death. The interview focuses on the lieutenant's knowledge of policies, procedures, and communications regarding Epstein's housing requirements, specifically the mandate that he have a cellmate after returning from suicide watch. The lieutenant asserts that this requirement was widely known, communicated verbally and via posted notes, and that staff should have acted when Epstein was found alone.",

    "The lieutenant expressed strong personal belief that Epstein died by suicide, stating \"Nobody killed that man. He did it himself.\"",
    "The interview reveals potential procedural failures: a midnight count slip showed an incorrect inmate count for the SHU (73 instead of 72), and the lieutenant indicated staff should have noticed Epstein was alone during rounds or when he was escorted back to his cell after attorney visits.",
    "The lieutenant defended Officer Thomas's decision to enter Epstein's cell alone upon finding him, citing emergency policy that allows entry to save a life without waiting for a supervisor or a second officer."
