    "Ghislaine Maxwell was in prison and unable to read discovery disks on her laptop, requiring use of a prison computer which could not read some files, creating logistical hurdles for her defense.",
    "The discovery included over 6,500 photographs in native format without CART numbers and with 'date created' dates after July 2019, and over 460 audio/visual files with similar metadata issues from various productions (SDNY GM SUPP, SDNY005, SDNY011).",
    "The defense requested metadata overlays with original metadata for files with anomalous dates and sought clarification on a gap in production numbers between SDNY_GM_02742044 and 2742183.",
    "The correspondence reveals the scale of digital evidence in the case, referencing specific CART numbers and production batches from investigations by SDNY, SDFL (Southern District of Florida), and PBPD (Palm Beach Police Department)."
