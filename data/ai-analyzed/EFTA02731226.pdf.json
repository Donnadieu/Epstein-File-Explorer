    "The prosecution seeks to add new charges against Ghislaine Maxwell for conspiracy to commit sex trafficking and sex trafficking of a minor, based on the allegations of 'Minor Victim-4'.",

    "Corroborating evidence includes witness testimony, message pads from Epstein's home with the victim's name/phone number (2003-2005), and a 2002 FedEx invoice for a package sent from Epstein's Manhattan address to the victim's home.",
    "The memo details Maxwell's specific alleged actions: scheduling appointments, asking for contact numbers, inquiring about the victim's sexual history, complimenting her nude body, and asking her to travel with them.",
    "The victim stated she used the money from Epstein to buy drugs, became addicted, and that her drug use was partly to numb the pain of the abuse.",
    "Phone records from 2004 confirm communication between Jane Doe and Jeffrey Epstein on at least two occasions during her minority.",
    "Juan Alessi confirmed that Ghislaine Maxwell recruited Jane Doe from her job at Mar-a-Lago to massage Epstein.",

    "Jane Doe admitted to lying under oath during her 2009 civil deposition about engaging in sex acts while working for an escort service.",
    "The prosecution proposes expanding charges against Maxwell to include sex trafficking (2001-2004) and extending conspiracy charges through 2004, based on Jane Doe's testimony.",
    "The prosecution has reviewed files from multiple agencies (SDNY, FBI, PBPD, PBSA) for discovery and Brady obligations and produced most materials to the defense, with a court-authorized delay for a subset related to victims not named in the indictment.",
    "The government expects to seek mandatory restitution for victims under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) to cover a wide range of losses, including medical, therapeutic, housing, and legal costs.",
    "Forfeiture of properties involved in the offense conduct is complicated because none belonged to Ghislaine Maxwell, requiring consultation with the Money Laundering and Asset Forfeiture Section (MLAF).",
    "Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested on July 2, 2020, has been detained since, and is held at the MDC; her trial is scheduled for July 12, 2021, with Speedy Trial Act time excluded by Judge Nathan.",
    "The case involves multiple victim-witnesses who have been entered into the Victim Notification System and connected with FBI victim specialists, indicating a victim-centered prosecution approach."
