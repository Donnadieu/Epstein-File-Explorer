    "The camera system at the Metropolitan Correctional Center was over 20 years old, analog, poorly maintained, and frequently malfunctioned.",
    "At the time of Jeffrey Epstein's death on August 10, 2019, only one hard drive of the camera system was working, and a hard drive failure occurred that day.",
    "Replacing the failed hard drives would have wiped all prior recorded data from the system.",
    "An FBI agent was reportedly the one who physically removed the DVR unit containing the failed hard drives after the incident.",
    "The interviewee, a BOP employee, was present during the response to Epstein's cell and participated in the attempted resuscitation."
