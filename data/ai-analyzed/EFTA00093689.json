  "keyFacts": [
    "U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman made highly unusual public statements criticizing Prince Andrew's lack of cooperation in the Epstein co-conspirator investigation, departing from standard DOJ practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations.",
    "Prince Andrew, after a widely criticized BBC interview in November 2019, stated he was willing to help law enforcement but, according to Berman, subsequently refused to submit to an interview.",
    "The article analyzes potential legal violations by Berman, concluding that while he may not have violated grand jury secrecy rules, his comments likely conflicted with the U.S. Attorney's Manual policy against discussing the 'nature or progress' of an investigation.",
    "Prince Andrew faces significant legal risks if he cooperates, including potential perjury charges due to specific alibis given in his BBC interview, and the fact there is no statute of limitations for federal sex trafficking offenses involving minors.",
    "The U.S. government's options to secure Prince Andrew's testimony include using the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with the UK or victims' lawyers using the Hague Convention to serve a subpoena."
