    "The document is a standard DOJ OIG evidence custody form (OIG Form 234/I dated 04/23/07).",
    "It records a property seizure, but the case number, location, description of the seized property, and the names of the witness and seizing officer are largely illegible or redacted.",
    "A chain of custody log is present, showing the item was transferred at least once, but the dates, times, purposes, and recipient names are unreadable.",
    "The document's poor legibility suggests it may be a scanned copy of a partially redacted or degraded original form."
