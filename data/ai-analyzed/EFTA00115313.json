    "Inmate Efrain Reyes, Jeffrey Epstein's cellmate, was pre-removed from MCC at 8:38 a.m. on August 9, 2019, after going to court and not returning.",
    "The witness states that if an inmate is WAB (With All Belongings) going to court, they are 'pretty much always gone' and unlikely to return, though rare exceptions occur.",
    "There were significant count discrepancies in the SHU on August 9-10, 2019; counts at 4:00 p.m., 10:00 p.m., and midnight all reported 73 inmates when only 72 were physically present, due to inmate Fernandez not being keyed out after being moved to a dry cell.",
    "The witness indicates that R&D does not proactively notify housing units when an inmate is not returning from court; notification typically only occurs if there is a property issue or a miscount.",
    "The witness believes Epstein took his own life, citing the environment as a 'culture shock' to him, and has no knowledge of anyone assisting him."
