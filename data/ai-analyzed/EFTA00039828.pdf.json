    "The whistleblower, Christopher Dilorio, alleges the SEC has used his detailed TCR information since 2011 to both bring enforcement actions (e.g., against Oppenheimer, Joshua Sason, Justin Keener) and to obstruct investigations that would implicate major players like Knight Capital (NITE) and UBS (UBSS).",
    "Dilorio's core claim is that Knight Capital (later KCG, now part of Virtu) is a criminal enterprise whose primary business is abusive naked shorting of OTC market shells to facilitate money laundering, and that the SEC has actively protected it since bailing it out after the 2012 'glitch'.",
    "The document points to a DTCC 'Global Lock' on Colorado Goldfields (CGFIA) in 2013 as 'smoking gun' evidence of naked shorting by a third-party broker-dealer, which the SEC allegedly ignored despite having Dilorio's information.",
    "Dilorio accuses the SEC Office of the Whistleblower and Inspector General Carl Hoecker of gross misconduct, including failing to distribute his information to investigators, not interviewing him, and not informing Congress of his serious allegations.",
    "The email outlines a vast network of alleged money laundering involving Michael Milken associates, shell companies (AQR blanks, NewLead, FreeSeas), Swiss banks (UBS), and entities linked to figures like Martin Schlaff, with connections to political figures (Trump, Kushner) and recent CARES Act fund recipients."
