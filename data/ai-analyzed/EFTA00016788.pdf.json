  "summary": "This is an addendum legal opinion by David Perry QC regarding English extradition law as it pertains to Ghislaine Maxwell's case. It responds to the US Government's opposition to Maxwell's release motion, concluding that Maxwell would almost certainly be extradited to the US if she fled to England and Wales, that bail would be refused, and that the UK Secretary of State has very limited discretion to refuse extradition.",

    "The opinion concludes it is 'highly unlikely' Ghislaine Maxwell could successfully resist extradition from England and Wales to the US on the charges she faces.",
    "If Maxwell fled the US after using a waiver of extradition to secure bail, then tried to resist extradition in the UK, bail would 'almost certainly be refused' during UK proceedings.",
    "The UK Secretary of State has extremely limited power to refuse extradition under the Extradition Act 2003, having used it only once (for Gary McKinnon) since the law's enactment.",
    "Most extradition cases from England and Wales to the US conclude within two years, or within three months if the person consents to extradition."
