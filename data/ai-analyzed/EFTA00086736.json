  "summary": "This is a legal memorandum filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team, supporting a motion to strike references to 'Accuser-3' from the superseding indictment. The defense argues the allegations regarding Accuser-3 are irrelevant surplusage because they involve no alleged travel (a key element of the Mann Act charges) and the accuser was above the age of consent in England, and that the allegations are unduly prejudicial. The document outlines the defense's legal arguments against the inclusion of these allegations.",

    "The defense motion seeks to remove all allegations regarding 'Accuser-3' from the indictment, arguing they are irrelevant surplusage meant to prejudice the jury.",
    "A core defense argument is that the Mann Act charges require allegations of travel, but there is no allegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled in interstate or foreign commerce.",
    "The defense argues that during the alleged interactions (1994-1995), Accuser-3 was at or above the age of consent in England (16), and the indictment does not allege the activity was nonconsensual or violated English law.",
    "The defense contends that allegations Accuser-3 was 'sexually abused' are inflammatory and prejudicial, and their inclusion is an attempt to circumvent Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) governing 'other acts' evidence.",
    "The motion reveals that Accuser-3 was born in March 1977, meaning she turned 25 in March 2002, which the defense argues makes any prosecution for conduct involving her time-barred under the statute of limitations in effect at the time."
