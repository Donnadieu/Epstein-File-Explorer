  "summary": "This is a legal memorandum filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team, supporting a motion to strike references to 'Accuser-3' from the superseding indictment. The defense argues the allegations regarding Accuser-3 are irrelevant, prejudicial, and insufficient to support the charged conspiracies under the Mann Act, as they involve no alleged travel and the accuser was above the age of consent in England.",

  "keyFacts": [
    "The defense argues allegations regarding Accuser-3 are surplusage because the indictment contains no allegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled, which is a core element of the Mann Act charges.",
    "Accuser-3 was above the legal age of consent in England (16) during all alleged interactions (1994-1995), and the indictment does not allege the sexual activity was nonconsensual or violated English law.",
    "The defense contends the statute of limitations for any offense involving Accuser-3 expired in March 2002 when she turned 25, making prosecution time-barred.",
    "The memorandum characterizes the government's inclusion of Accuser-3 allegations as a prejudicial attempt to introduce 'other acts' evidence that should be governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).",
    "The filing reveals Accuser-3 was born in March 1977, as disclosed by the government."
