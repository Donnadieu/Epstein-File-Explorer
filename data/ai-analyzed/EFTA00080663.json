    "The government possessed approximately 40,000 images extracted from CDs seized from Epstein's New York residence, with thousands designated as 'Highly Confidential' due to nudity.",

    "Defense attorney Laura Menninger argued that many 'Highly Confidential' designated images contained only adult nudity, not child pornography, and requested copies for proper defense review, challenging the restrictive designation.",
    "Physical evidence, including 'boots' recently taken into evidence, was being transported between New York and Colorado for defense review, with logistical coordination involving FBI agents.",
    "There were widespread technical problems with the discovery production, including corrupt files, unreadable photo formats, missing metadata, and difficulties for the defendant to review materials at the MDC (Metropolitan Detention Center)."
