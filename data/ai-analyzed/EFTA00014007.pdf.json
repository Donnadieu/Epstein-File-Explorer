    "Epstein was held at a 'stockade,' not the main jail, and was eligible for work release—contradicting what officials told agents months earlier.",
    "Epstein's defense team (Goldberger and a psychiatrist) met with him and threatened a lawsuit (involving Ken Starr) if he received unfavorable treatment.",
    "The email reveals Epstein falsely claimed higher education (a master's degree) but in reality only had a high school diploma, making him ineligible to teach GED classes as he had offered."
