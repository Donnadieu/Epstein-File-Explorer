    "The U.S. Virgin Islands Attorney General filed a civil RICO lawsuit against Jeffrey Epstein's estate on January 15, 2020.",
    "Attorney Russell Pate, acting as private counsel for the USVI AG, emailed numerous victim attorneys to coordinate legal strategies and encourage them to praise the AG in the media.",
    "Pate's email included an offer to host victim attorneys for a free recreational trip to the US Virgin Islands, including a cabin on a catamaran charter.",
    "The email states the USVI's legal action is intended to help victims secure \"full, fair and open settlements\" from Epstein's estate, which is believed to have sufficient assets.",
    "The communication was criticized within the email chain as highly unusual and potentially unethical for a private attorney acting under state authority."
