    "In April 2020, prosecutors were actively seeking to locate Ghislaine Maxwell, with a belief she might be residing at a boyfriend's residence in Massachusetts.",
    "Investigators were tracking a phone number (917-520-3106) registered to Maxwell's entity, the 'Terramar Project,' to confirm if she was personally using it.",
    "A pen register on the suspected phone number had expired about a month prior to the email, and prosecutors inquired about reactivating it.",
    "Prosecutors noted they had not yet received approximately 41 FBI interview reports (302s), including one from an interview conducted about two months prior, hindering their review.",
    "Technical problems with exporting data to the 'Relativity' review platform were preventing AUSAs from accessing search warrant return materials directly."
