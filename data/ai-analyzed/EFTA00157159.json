    "The FBI's NY CART team was processing terabytes of digital evidence seized from Jeffrey Epstein's properties, including phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers.",
    "Evidence included items from a July 2007 search of an Epstein property, where 9 IDE hard drives (3 copies of 3 drives) were found in his Manhattan apartment.",
    "The U.S. Attorney's Office needed the data in a specific, searchable format (for Relativity) to conduct discovery and taint review, but faced challenges with prior data transfers being unusable.",
    "The correspondence indicates significant staffing and logistical challenges (including pandemic-related reductions) that delayed the evidence processing and transfer timeline.",
    "The evidence list referenced specific device types not yet transferred, including 2 Macs, a DVR, an iPhone, and an iPad from the New York searches, and additional 'Island stuff'.",
    "Digital evidence seized from Epstein's properties was massive, involving approximately 40+ storage devices and 60+ CDs from the New York mansion, and more than 25 devices including servers from the Virgin Islands.",
    "The U.S. Attorney's Office received a hard drive with over a million documents but lacked a system to identify which devices the materials came from or what was new versus previously received evidence.",
    "The FBI confirmed that CDs from the New York search 'only contained pictures, no documents' and that an initial screen was conducted to check for child pornography (CP), with the answer being 'no'.",
    "An FBI forensic examiner cited internal network upgrades requiring the deletion of 'about 400 TB worth' of data as causing a delay in their response.",
    "The correspondence underscores significant logistical and organizational challenges in processing the vast amount of digital evidence in the Epstein case post-arrest."
