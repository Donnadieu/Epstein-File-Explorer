    "The FBI was actively planning to indict Jeffrey Epstein in late June/early July 2019, with a target date of Tuesday, July 2, 2019.",
    "At the time of the emails, Jeffrey Epstein was outside the continental United States (OCONUS), and his arrest was planned for when he returned to the US.",
    "There was significant inter-agency coordination and pressure to transfer documents from the FBI's Miami Field Office (MM/WPBRA investigation) to the Southern District of New York (SDNY) to support the indictment and potential expedited trial.",
    "The FBI's Office of General Counsel (OGC) initially would not authorize the release of the original files, leading to a pursuit of a 'doclab' digitization option as an alternative.",
    "The email chain highlights internal FBI efforts to avoid an 'escalation' from the SDNY regarding the document transfer delays."
