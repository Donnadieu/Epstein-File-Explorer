  "keyFacts": [
    "Amazon's legal team was actively negotiating with prosecutors in August 2019 regarding a subpoena for records related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "Amazon raised significant First Amendment concerns, arguing that records of 'expressive materials' (books, videos) purchased by or shipped to Epstein require a heightened legal standard to compel production.",
    "The legal team cited multiple court cases establishing precedent that bookstores, video providers, and libraries have special protections against revealing patron choices without a compelling need, substantial nexus to the investigation, and exhaustion of other avenues.",
    "The death of Jeffrey Epstein was noted as a potential factor that might affect the evaluation of First Amendment privacy interests related to the subpoena.",
    "Amazon indicated it might file a motion to quash the subpoena if prosecutors continued to pursue the records of expressive materials."
