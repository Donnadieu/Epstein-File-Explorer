    "Correctional officers Michael Thomas and Tova Noel are criminally charged for falsifying inmate count slips on the night Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in his cell.",
    "The court order denies Thomas's motion to compel production of the DOJ Inspector General's report on Epstein's death and related materials, as the government stated a draft report did not yet exist and all investigatory materials had been provided.",
    "The order also denies Thomas's request for Bureau of Prisons internal reports, finding the BOP was not part of the 'prosecution team' for this criminal case.",
    "The government had already produced extensive discovery including surveillance video, count slips, staffing records, phone records, employee files, and witness statements from the investigation.",
    "Thomas argued unsuccessfully that falsifying count slips was a widespread, tolerated practice at the BOP and sought discovery for a potential selective prosecution defense."
