The document provides detailed factual and legal arguments supporting the prosecution's position.",

    "The government obtained Maxwell's civil deposition transcripts via a grand jury subpoena and a court order modifying a protective order, which it defends as lawful and not requiring suppression.",
    "The perjury counts are based on allegedly false statements Maxwell made during her April and July 2016 depositions in the Giuffre defamation case, including denials about knowing of a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages and about giving massages.",
    "The government opposes severance of the perjury counts from the substantive sex trafficking counts, arguing they are logically connected and provable through overlapping evidence, including victim testimony."
