  "keyFacts": [
    "The court denied Ghislaine Maxwell's request for a broad exception to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who had made any public statement 'relating to' her or Jeffrey Epstein, finding the exception too broad and protective of privacy interests.",
    "The court adopted the Government's language, allowing Maxwell to publicly reference only individuals who have spoken by name on the record in *this* specific criminal case.",
    "The court denied Maxwell's request to restrict potential Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for the criminal trial, calling the request 'unprecedented' and unnecessary.",
    "The ruling emphasizes the strong interest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses, even if they have made past public statements."
