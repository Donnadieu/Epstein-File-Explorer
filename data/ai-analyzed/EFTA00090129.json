  "summary": "This is a defense expert disclosure filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's legal team in her criminal case. It outlines the expected testimony of two defense experts, Dr. Elizabeth Loftus and Dr. Park Dietz, who will challenge the reliability of witness memories and the concept of 'grooming' as applied to Maxwell. This document is a defense filing in the Ghislaine Maxwell case, likely a notice of expert witnesses. It outlines psychological pathways to false allegations of sexual assault and introduces several defense experts who will testify on topics including forensic psychiatry, prosecutorial misconduct, computer forensics, financial investigation, and document analysis.",
