  "summary": "This is an academic review article published in the journal 'Child Abuse Review' in 2015, summarizing research on patterns of disclosure in child sexual abuse, including delays, non-disclosure, and partial disclosure. It discusses findings from various studies and implications for practice. The document is not a primary case file but a research paper cited within the Epstein document set, likely for background or expert context. This is an academic article from the journal 'Child Abuse Review' (2015) titled 'Disclosure Patterns in Child Sexual Abuse'. It reviews research on the complexities of how and when children disclose sexual abuse, focusing on delayed disclosure, barriers, strategies, and implications for legal and therapeutic systems. It cites numerous studies and authors in the field.",

    "The paper reviews research consensus that most victims of childhood sexual abuse do not disclose until adulthood, and significant delays are common when disclosure occurs in childhood.",
    "Studies cited show high rates of non-disclosure; for example, 26-28% of participants in large US studies had never disclosed prior to the research survey.",
    "Disclosure patterns are influenced by factors such as the child's age, relationship to the abuser (longer delays for intra-familial abuse), gender (boys more reluctant), and fear of consequences.",
    "Research highlights the importance of being asked direct questions, as many children may not disclose simply because they were not asked.",
    "The article emphasizes implications for legal, child protection, and therapeutic contexts, stressing the need to understand and facilitate the disclosure process.",
    "The article is a scholarly review focusing on the patterns and challenges of disclosure in child sexual abuse cases, not a direct legal document from the Epstein case.",
    "It discusses how delayed and partial disclosure is common and poses challenges for legal investigations and prosecutions.",
    "It cites research indicating many young people disclose first to a peer, and adolescence may be a critical period for disclosure.",
    "The article references Irish legal proceedings in the 1990s where psychological expert testimony was used to explain delays in reporting abuse.",
    "It emphasizes the need for sensitive, non-leading questioning by professionals and the importance of creating opportunities for children to disclose."
