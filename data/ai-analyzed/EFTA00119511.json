    "Mark Epstein claims Jeffrey Epstein's neck groove proves he was dead for 2-6 hours when found.",
    "The neck groove is described as too narrow to match a sheet noose and more consistent with an electric cord or garroting.",
    "The groove's position low on the neck is argued to be inconsistent with a hanging, which would leave a groove higher up towards the ears.",
    "The email includes attachments of autopsy images (PATH-Autopsy_019.JPG, PATH-Autopsy_020.JPG, PATH-Autopsy_021.JPG).",
    "This correspondence shows active dispute and investigation into the circumstances of Jeffrey Epstein's death years after the event."
