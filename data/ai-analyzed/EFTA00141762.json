    "The OIG's investigation found a lack of a contingency plan to assign Epstein a new cellmate after his previous cellmate was transferred, which increased the likelihood he was housed alone at the time of his death.",
    "The BOP's response to Recommendation 2 (ensuring continuity of cellmate assignment) was deemed non-responsive by the OIG, as it did not address the need for a contingency plan.",
    "The BOP's response to Recommendation 7 (evaluating cell search procedures) was also deemed non-responsive, as it only mentioned discussing existing policies, not evaluating and improving them.",
    "The document outlines eight specific policy and procedural recommendations for the BOP stemming from the Epstein case, focusing on suicide watch protocols, inmate accountability, staffing, and security systems."
