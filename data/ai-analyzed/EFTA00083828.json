  "summary": "This is a transcript of Jeffrey Epstein's initial appearance, arraignment, and bail hearing before Magistrate Judge Henry B. Pitman in the Southern District of New York on July 8, 2019. Epstein pleads not guilty to sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking charges. The government argues for pretrial detention, citing his extreme wealth, risk of flight, danger to the community, and evidence from a recent search of his home. Defense counsel requests an adjournment to prepare a bail package, arguing the charges are a 'do-over' of a previously resolved Florida investigation.",
