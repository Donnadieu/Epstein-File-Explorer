  "summary": "This is an FBI Computer Analysis Response Team (CART) report detailing the forensic cloning and imaging of 18 hard drives from a surveillance system at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York. The work was conducted in August 2019 as part of the death investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. Three of the 18 hard drives were found to be non-functional. This document contains an FBI 302 report of an interview with a Bureau of Prisons forensic psychologist regarding her evaluation of Jeffrey Epstein on July 24, 2019, after a prior incident. It includes her detailed suicide risk assessment report and an internal email about removing Epstein from psychological observation. The psychologist describes Epstein's mental state, his denial of suicidal intent, and the decision to step him down from suicide watch. This document contains an FBI 302 report detailing an interview with a Bureau of Prisons Material Handler regarding the night of Jeffrey Epstein's death, focusing on counts, rounds, and staff conduct at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. It also includes administrative worksheets and logs from the FBI's evidence response team documentation of the Special Housing Unit (SHU) where Epstein died, conducted at the request of Attorney General William Barr.",

    "The FBI forensically processed 18 hard drives from a surveillance system at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York in August 2019.",
    "The processing was part of Case ID 90A-NY-3151227, a death investigation where Jeffrey Epstein is listed as the subject and victim.",
    "Three of the 18 hard drives (evidence items 1B5, 1B13, and 1B14) were found to be non-functional ('dead') and could not be cloned or imaged.",
    "The report is a technical record of the chain of custody and forensic duplication process, creating clone copies and forensic images (E01 files) of the drives for investigative analysis.",
    "The document confirms active FBI evidence processing related to Epstein's death occurred shortly after it happened in August 2019.",
    "On July 24, 2019, a forensic psychologist evaluated Jeffrey Epstein and found his overall acute suicide risk to be 'Low' and chronic risk 'Absent', leading to his removal from Suicide Watch to Psychological Observation.",
    "Epstein reported a lack of memory about the incident that caused a scar on his neck, claimed his cell mate called him a 'pedophile', and expressed fear for his safety if returned to the same cell.",
    "The psychologist's report noted Epstein's static risk factors included 'High Profile Crime', 'Lack of family connections', and 'Sex offender status'. Protective factors included his denial of suicidal intent and future orientation.",
    "An internal email dated July 30, 2019, indicates Epstein was being taken off Psychological Observation and needed a new cellmate.",
    "The psychologist stated she made the decision to step Epstein down with the consent of the Associate Warden and was cautious due to Epstein's vague self-reporting about the neck injury.",
    "The 10pm institutional count in the SHU on August 9, 2019, was not conducted, as confirmed by the interviewed officer who left at 10pm and stated NOEL could not have done it alone.",
    "Officer NOEL was the designated SHU officer and is indicated as having filled out the 30 Minute Check Sheet, though rounds were not consistently performed due to staff exhaustion and corner-cutting.",
    "Jeffrey Epstein was alone in his cell on the night of his death after his cellmate was released; control center should have notified SHU staff by 4pm.",
    "The FBI Evidence Response Team documented the SHU crime scene on August 17, 2019, at the direct request of Attorney General William Barr.",
    "The interview reveals systemic issues at MCC including mandated overtime, officer fatigue, and failure to consistently perform required inmate checks and counts."
