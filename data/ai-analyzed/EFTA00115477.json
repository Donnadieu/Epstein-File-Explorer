    "There were significant count discrepancies in the SHU on the night of August 9-10, 2019, due to an inmate (Fernandez) being moved to a dry cell in R&D but not being properly keyed out of the SHU population.",
    "The interviewed officer states that if staff knew an inmate was leaving \"WAB\" (With All Belongings) and knew Epstein required a cellmate, they should have taken immediate action to assign a new cellmate, but communication failures and lack of training at the MCC were common.",
    "Camera coverage in the SHU at the time was poor; the Control Center could only see a distant, unclear view of the multi-purpose area, not the individual cell ranges.",
    "The officer expresses her personal belief that Jeffrey Epstein took his own life, citing the environment as a \"culture shock\" to him, and states she has no knowledge or reason to believe anyone else was involved."
