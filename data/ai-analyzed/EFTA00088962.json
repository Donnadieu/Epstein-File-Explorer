    "A prosecutor analyzed charging someone as an 'accessory after the fact' (18 U.S.C. § 3) versus for 'misprision of a felony' in relation to a crime committed by an unspecified principal offender.",
    "The analysis notes that for a principal crime punishable by life imprisonment or death, an accessory after the fact faces up to 15 years imprisonment.",
    "The email calculates that for conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, being an accessory could result in a guidelines range of 41-51 months (with a role reduction) or 57-71 months (without), whereas misprision could result in 21-27 months (no reduction) or 12-18 months (with reduction), with a statutory cap of 3 years.",
    "The document suggests prosecutors were considering different legal theories for charging individuals who may have assisted Jeffrey Epstein or other offenders after their crimes."
