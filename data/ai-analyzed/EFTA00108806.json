    "The FBI's 'Baleen Sweep' project was processing telephone records, with a specific target number 340-771-2024, believed to belong to Epstein or his associates or potential victims.",

    "The request emphasizes that all information and phone records from the address book are considered unclassified, but the scanning process itself occurs on a SECRET-level system."
