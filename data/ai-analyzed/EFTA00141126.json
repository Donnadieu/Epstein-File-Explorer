    "The interviewee admitted that 30-minute check logs were sometimes filled out after the fact or even without performing the checks, a practice he disagreed with.",
    "Epstein was in the attorney conference room for the entire duration of the interviewee's shift on August 9, 2019, and never returned to the SHU during that time.",
    "The interviewee was on frequent military orders, including for approximately half of his three-month SHU rotation, which may have impacted his continuity and awareness of specific inmate protocols."
