    "The document is a series of emails from March 2020 between attorneys discussing a submission to prosecutors on behalf of an unnamed client, strongly implied to be Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "The defense argues for a non-prosecution disposition, portraying the client as 'a cog in Epstein's wheel, acting entirely at his direction' and as 'a very vulnerable victim' at the time of the alleged actions.",
    "Delays in preparing the submission are attributed to the client's 'emotionally and psychologically fragile state,' inability to get proper therapy due to COVID-19, and attorneys working remotely.",
    "Prosecutors reference a civil lawsuit filed by the client, making it difficult to explain why she can file a complaint but not make a submission to their office.",
    "The correspondence highlights the defense strategy of emphasizing the client's victimhood and coercion by Epstein to seek a favorable legal outcome."
