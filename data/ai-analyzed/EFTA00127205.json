    "There were significant issues with the MCC's camera recording system. Two hard drives were down, stopping recording for half the institution's cameras, including in the SHU. New camera equipment had been on site since October 2018 but was not installed until after Epstein's death.",
    "The witness gathered documentation after Epstein's death, including a 'court documentation regarding WAB' for Reyes, indicating she had evidence of the transfer on August 9, though she could not later locate the specific document."
