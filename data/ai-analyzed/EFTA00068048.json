    "The email author, Susan Harriman, claims that FINRA's BrokerCheck shows no record of Jeffrey Epstein ever being licensed to work at Bear Stearns, contradicting his claimed employment history.",
    "Harriman presents an unrelated case involving two Ivy League Directors of Cardiology, a Cayman Islands hedge fund whose largest investor is Abbott Labs, and $150M in cash from Colombia for seed research clinical trials completed in 2015.",
    "One of the clinical trials mentioned is for Heartmate, a device owned by Abbott Labs, where 26 patients died and 28,882 Medicare-reimbursed patients had to return to the hospital.",
    "The email suggests the cardiology case may emanate from a massive securities fraud case that sent money to the hedge fund.",
    "The document is dated July 13, 2019, during the period of heightened public and media interest in Jeffrey Epstein following his arrest."
