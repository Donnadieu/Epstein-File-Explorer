    "Law enforcement was actively planning a substantial search operation for Jeffrey Epstein's Little St. James Island in early August 2019.",
    "The search planning involved coordination between multiple agencies including the FBI's New York Field Office, SDNY, CBP, and USCG.",
    "Logistical challenges included limited hotel availability on St. Thomas due to a prior hurricane and the need to transport personnel, equipment, and water to the island.",
    "The warrant for Epstein's NYC residence resulted in 845 pictures taken over 13 hours, setting a precedent for the planned island search.",
    "The SDNY preferred to isolate the 2019 case from the investigation into Epstein that occurred approximately 12 years prior."
