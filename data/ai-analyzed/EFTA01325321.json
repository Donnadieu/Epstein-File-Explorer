  "summary": "This document is a FOIA request submitted by James Robertson, Senior Managing Editor of The National Enquirer, seeking records related to the FBI's investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein for sexual trafficking of minors. The request emphasizes the public interest in the case, particularly in light of Epstein's connections and the favorable treatment he received from the DOJ, as well as the ongoing civil defamation trial involving one of Epstein's victims and Ghislaine Maxwell. This document consists of a series of letters from the FBI to Daniel Novack, representing Radar Online, regarding requests made under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) concerning Jeffrey Epstein. The letters detail the processing of these requests, the exemptions applied to withheld information, and the procedures for appeal and dispute resolution.",
