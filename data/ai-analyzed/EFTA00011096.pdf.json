    "The defense argues that 'an unprecedented amount of media coverage' has tried, convicted, and condemned Ghislaine Maxwell in the court of public opinion, creating a high risk of juror bias.",
    "The motion cites extensive pretrial publicity including documentaries (Netflix's 'Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich'), podcasts, books, and widespread social media coverage about Maxwell and Epstein.",
    "The defense contends that the sensitive nature of the sex abuse charges, combined with high-profile New York sex scandals (e.g., Cuomo, Weinstein), makes standard group voir dire insufficient to uncover juror prejudices.",
    "The document states that Epstein's 2008 Florida case, his death in 2019, and the subsequent DOJ OPR report have created an 'incalculable spillover effect' of negative publicity that prejudices Maxwell's case.",
    "The defense requests individual sequestered voir dire and limited attorney questioning to increase juror candor on sensitive topics like personal experiences with sexual abuse and exposure to pretrial media."
