  "summary": "This is a letter from Ghislaine Maxwell's defense attorney Bobbi C. Sternheim to Judge Alison J. Nathan, opposing the Metropolitan Detention Center's (MDC) objection to allowing Maxwell weekend and holiday access to a laptop computer for discovery review. The letter argues that the MDC's prison computers are inadequate for handling millions of pages of discovery, and that restricting laptop access severely hampers Maxwell's ability to prepare her defense.",
