    "The interview is part of the official DOJ OIG investigation into the death of Jeffrey Epstein and surrounding circumstances at MCC.",
    "The BOP employee witness explains that inmate call-out lists (not court lists) are created in the Sentry system, printed, and disseminated, but are typically deleted and recreated daily, making them difficult to obtain after the fact.",
    "Emails from the U.S. Marshal Service show inmate Efrain Reyes was scheduled for transfer from MCC to a GEO facility on August 9, 2019, explaining his 'pre-removed' status on logs.",
    "Protocol dictates that when an inmate is physically moved from one housing unit to another (e.g., SHU to 9 North), control center should be notified immediately to update the system, ensuring accurate counts.",
    "The BOP uses a chit (C-H-I-T) system for equipment/key accountability, not a sign-out system. Each officer has personalized chits they exchange for equipment."
