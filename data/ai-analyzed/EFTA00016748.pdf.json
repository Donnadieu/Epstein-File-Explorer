    "One of the payment recipients is identified in the indictment as an employee who allegedly facilitated Epstein's sex trafficking by contacting victims and scheduling encounters.",
    "The identities of the two payment recipients are redacted in the public version of this letter, with the government citing the need to protect the ongoing investigation and the individuals involved."
