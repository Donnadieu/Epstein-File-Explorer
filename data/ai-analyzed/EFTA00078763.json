  "summary": "This is a letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York to Judge Alison J. Nathan regarding the proposed protective order in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell. The government opposes two specific modifications requested by the defense: (1) allowing the defense to publicly name victims who have spoken publicly about Epstein or Maxwell in any forum, and (2) imposing restrictions on the government's use of its own investigative materials. The government argues these requests lack legal basis and would harm victims' privacy.",

    "The government strongly opposes allowing the defense to publicly name victims who have ever spoken about Epstein or Maxwell in any public forum, calling the request 'extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate.'",
    "The government argues victim privacy is protected by the Crime Victims' Rights Act and that public identification could deter other victims from coming forward.",
    "The defense's proposed order would allow naming victims based on any past public statement (e.g., social media, podcasts), which the government says victims could not have anticipated would be used in this case.",
    "The government also opposes the defense's request to restrict how the government uses its own investigative documents with witnesses, calling it unprecedented and without legal basis.",
    "The government states its proposed order already allows the defense to reference victim names in sealed filings, in private investigative conversations, and for victims who have chosen to be publicly identified in *this* case."
