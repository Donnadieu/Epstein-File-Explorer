    "The witness, a BOP electronics technician, stated the cameras at MCC were 'always working' but there were issues with recording and retrieving video footage prior to Epstein's death.",
    "The camera upgrade was significantly delayed due to logistical issues (nowhere to store 300+ cameras), approval problems with camera models, and lack of authorized personnel to sign for deliveries.",
    "SigNet, the contractor, did not ship the new cameras until after Epstein's death in August 2019, despite the contract being awarded in September 2018.",
    "The witness had no key to the DVR/recorder room prior to Epstein's death; access was controlled by SIS staff, which complicated fixing system issues.",
    "The wiring infrastructure for the new camera system was incomplete at the time of Epstein's death, with only one housing unit fully piped for installation."
