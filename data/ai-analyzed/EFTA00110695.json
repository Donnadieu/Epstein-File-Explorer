    "The interviewee, a BOP lieutenant, was the activities lieutenant at MCC on August 9, 2019, but has limited recollection of specific details from that day, including his exact end time and whether he conducted a round in the SHU.",
    "The lieutenant states he had no conversation with Officer about Nicholas Tartaglione going WAB, contradicting the implication of a memo written by Officer.",
    "Analysis of count slips from August 9-10 suggests counts in the SHU were not properly conducted, with discrepancies (e.g., 73 vs. 72) indicating staff may have been falsifying counts or only doing rounds, not actual counts.",
    "The lieutenant believed Epstein required a cellmate for three reasons: 1) standard SHU policy (unless special status), 2) an email sent when he came off suicide watch, and 3) his presence on the 'hotlist' for suicidal inmates.",
    "The lieutenant opined that the primary failure leading to Epstein's death was the lack of proper 30-minute rounds and counts in the SHU, considering the cellmate issue a secondary, and somewhat inevitable, administrative lapse in a busy jail."
