  "summary": "This is a letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York to Judge Robert W. Sweet, requesting a limited order to unseal civil discovery materials held by the law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP. The materials are sought via a grand jury subpoena for an ongoing criminal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and others for sex trafficking and enticement of minors. The government argues that the protective order in the civil case should be modified to allow compliance with the subpoena, citing legal precedent and the gravity of the investigation.",

    "The U.S. Attorney's Office was conducting an active, non-public grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein for sex trafficking and enticement of minors as of February 2019.",

    "A protective order in the civil case was the only obstacle to compliance, as the law firm was willing to comply with the subpoena.",
    "The government argued that avoiding embarrassment is not a valid reason to uphold confidentiality against a legitimate law enforcement need, especially for grave crimes like the sexual exploitation of minors.",
    "The investigation's existence and scope were not publicly known at the time, and the government was concerned about alerting potential targets."
