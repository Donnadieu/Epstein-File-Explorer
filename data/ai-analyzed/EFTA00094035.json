  "summary": "This is the prepared testimony of David E. Patton, Executive Director of Federal Defenders of New York, before a House Judiciary subcommittee oversight hearing on the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the implementation of the First Step Act. The testimony criticizes BOP's history of mismanagement, citing the 2019 power outage crisis at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn and the suicide of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan as examples of systemic failures. It raises concerns about the BOP's ability to faithfully implement the First Step Act, particularly regarding programming, the PATTERN risk assessment tool, and the closure of Residential Reentry Centers. A letter from the Federal Public Defender for the Western District of Washington to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, detailing systemic Bureau practices that are causing the closure and financial endangerment of reentry centers (halfway houses) across the United States. The letter argues these practices contradict Congressional mandates like the Second Chance Act and the First Step Act, and urges immediate corrective action. This document contains a letter from Federal Public Defender Thomas W. Hillier to the Acting Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Thomas R. Kane, providing formal comment on proposed regulations implementing the Second Chance Act's pre-release community confinement provisions. The letter argues the BOP's proposed regulation fails to comply with congressional mandates, should incorporate a presumption of maximum community corrections, and should reject an informal six-month limitation rule. An attachment lists Residential Reentry Center contracts expiring or not being renewed in 2017-2018. This document is a compilation of news articles from Reuters and CNN (dated 2017-2019) and a related Bureau of Prisons internal memorandum from October 2017. It details the Trump administration's decision to cut funding and cancel contracts for 16 federal halfway houses (Residential Reentry Centers), citing fiscal constraints. The articles include reactions from judges, advocacy groups, and affected individuals, framing the cuts as contrary to criminal justice reform efforts. This document is the Bureau of Prisons' 2018 annual report to Congress on the utilization of community corrections facilities (Residential Reentry Centers and home confinement), as required by the Second Chance Act. It provides statistical data from April 2017 through March 2018, explains eligibility criteria, and outlines recent activities and future goals for inmate reentry programs.",
