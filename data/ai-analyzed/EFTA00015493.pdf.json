    "The document references a psychological reconstruction prepared after Epstein's death and responses to it, which include drafts and a timeline of events.",
    "The BOP withheld 274 pages of inmate census rosters from July-August 2019 to protect the privacy of other inmates incarcerated at the MCC at the same time as Epstein, arguing disclosure would associate them with Epstein in a government document.",

    "The BOP argues that disclosing personally identifying information of BOP employees, other inmates, visitors, fund senders, or legal counsel could lead to targeting or harassment, especially given the public speculation surrounding Epstein's death.",
    "One specific redaction pertains to Epstein's inmate profile, withholding details on how BOP classifies inmates for security purposes, which is claimed to be a protected law enforcement technique.",
    "The document cites FOIA Exemptions 7(E) and 7(F) to withhold information about MCC operations (e.g., counts, use of body alarms) arguing disclosure could risk circumvention of the law and endanger the safety of staff and inmates."
