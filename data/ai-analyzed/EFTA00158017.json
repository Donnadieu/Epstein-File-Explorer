  "summary": "This is a transcript of a videotaped deposition taken on November 6, 2009, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, related to multiple civil cases against Jeffrey Epstein. The witness, a mother, is being questioned by defense attorney Mark Luttier about her daughter's troubled adolescence, including dropping out of school and associating with an individual whose name is redacted. This document is a deposition transcript where a mother is being questioned about her daughter's relationship with an older man and her subsequent employment at Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach residence. The mother describes meeting Epstein, receiving money from him, and her daughter's changing behavior, but expresses initial trust in the situation. This document is a deposition transcript where a witness, likely a mother, is being questioned about her daughter's work and activities at Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach residence. The testimony describes the daughter's employment, the mother's suspicions about her daughter's behavior, and interactions with Epstein and his staff. This document is a deposition transcript where a witness (likely a mother) is being questioned about her daughter's involvement with Jeffrey Epstein. The witness describes learning from her daughter about visits to Epstein's estate, where the daughter was paid to bring other girls, modeled in lingerie for photographs, and performed massages. The witness states she first learned the full extent of the activities when FBI agents visited their home to speak with her daughter. This document is a transcript excerpt from a deposition taken on November 6, 2009, in a civil case (Case No. 08-CIV-80119-MARRA/JOHNSON) involving Jeffrey Epstein. The witness, a mother, is questioned about her daughter's relationship with Epstein, the daughter's behavioral and drug issues, and the involvement of another man. The deposition explores the timeline of the daughter's troubles and their potential connection to Epstein.",
