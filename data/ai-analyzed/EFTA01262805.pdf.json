    "The FBI sought a warrant to search and photograph the interior of Jeffrey Epstein's 9 East 71st Street mansion to corroborate victim accounts of sexual abuse that occurred there from 2002-2005.",
    "Epstein was indicted on July 2, 2019, for sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking of minors, specifically for abusing dozens of girls as young as 14.",
    "The indictment describes a systematic scheme where Epstein paid victims hundreds of dollars in cash for sexual encounters and incentivized them to recruit other minor girls, creating a 'vast network' of victims.",
    "Epstein controlled the New York residence through corporate entities (Nine East 71st Street Corp. and later Maple, Inc.), with a 2011 transfer for $10 indicating a sham transaction to maintain ownership.",
    "The affidavit reveals that a key victim (Victim-1) provided detailed descriptions of the mansion's interior, which investigators believed remained structurally unchanged since the mid-2000s, making photographic evidence valuable for corroboration."
