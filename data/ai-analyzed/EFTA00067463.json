    "The email reveals significant discrepancies in Jeffrey Epstein's statements to the court: he claimed to work 'every day' at the Florida Science Foundation, which he said had existed for 'a couple of years,' but state records showed it was incorporated only in November 2007.",
    "The address for the Florida Science Foundation was Jack Goldberger's law office suite, and there was no physical evidence (building directory, suite door, tenant knowledge) that such a business operated there.",
    "Epstein had not been in Palm Beach County in the six months prior to the email, contradicting his claim of working there 'every day.'",
    "The Assistant U.S. Attorney expresses concern that Epstein's proposed work release—in his attorney's office suite making calls, web-surfing, and having food delivered—does not align with the objectives of imprisonment.",
    "The email attaches a portion of Epstein's non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office, indicating ongoing legal negotiations and oversight of his sentence."
