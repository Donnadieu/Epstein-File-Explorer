    "The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the unsealing of Ghislaine Maxwell's April 2016 deposition transcript and related litigation materials.",
    "The court rejected Maxwell's argument that her privacy interests outweighed the public's interest in access to the judicial documents.",
    "The deposition materials were deemed judicial documents subject to a presumption of public access, though with a lower presumption than materials connected to dispositive motions.",
    "The appeal was separate from Maxwell's criminal case (United States v. Maxwell, No. 20-3061-cr), and the motion to consolidate the appeals was denied.",
    "Intervenors including journalist Julie Brown and Miami Herald Media Company successfully argued for unsealing the materials."
