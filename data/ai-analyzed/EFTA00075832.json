    "DVR1 from the Metropolitan Correctional Center was successfully configured and made reviewable on September 18, 2019, with video to be uploaded for analysis.",
    "DVR2 experienced a hard disk failure around July 29, 2019, and was not fixed before FBI custody; thus, it contains no video data from August 2019.",
    "The failure of DVR2 went unnoticed until early August 2019, when the vendor SigNet was contacted for support.",
    "Data on DVR2 is believed to exist from approximately July 14/15 to July 29, 2019, but this is unconfirmed and recovery would be time-intensive with no guarantee of success.",
    "The email chain involves FBI personnel from the Digital Forensic Analysis Unit and Operational Technology Division discussing the technical status of MCC surveillance systems."
