    "The court denied Ghislaine Maxwell's request to subpoena the entire teenage diary of 'Minor Victim-2,' finding the request a 'fishing expedition' aimed at impeachment, which is not proper under Rule 17(c).",
    "The Government and the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP both represented that the victim's diary does not mention Ghislaine Maxwell and that the victim stopped writing in it shortly after meeting Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "Maxwell also sought a pair of black boots allegedly given to the victim by her and Epstein; the Government stated the FBI would obtain them and make them available to the defense, rendering the subpoena moot.",
    "Requests for original photographs were partially moot as the Government would provide access, and otherwise denied as the defense failed to establish relevance beyond potential impeachment.",
    "The order underscores the high bar for issuing Rule 17(c) subpoenas, requiring a showing of specific relevance that goes beyond mere impeachment of witnesses."
