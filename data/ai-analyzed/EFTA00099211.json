    "Judge Alison J. Nathan denied Ghislaine Maxwell's request to direct the MDC to stop flashlight checks during the night, finding the request factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.",
    "The court ordered the MDC to consider whether sleep disruptions for pretrial detainees can be reduced and to ensure Maxwell is only subjected to necessary security protocols based on neutral factors.",
    "The Government reported that MDC staff conduct flashlight checks of all inmates as standard procedure, with checks every 30 minutes for those in the Special Housing Unit and multiple checks per night for general population inmates.",
    "Flashlights are pointed at the ceiling of the cell during checks to confirm the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress, not directly into their eyes as claimed by defense.",
    "The MDC determined that more frequent safety checks for Maxwell were necessary due to her being housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the high-profile nature of the case."
