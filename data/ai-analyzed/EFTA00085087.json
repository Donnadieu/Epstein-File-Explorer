First, they seek an order compelling the government to disclose the identities of the three alleged victims (Victims 1-3) referenced in the indictment. Second, they request an order directing the Bureau of Prisons to improve Maxwell's detention conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC), including releasing her to general population and granting her increased access to discovery materials to prepare her defense.",

    "The defense argues it cannot prepare a fair defense without knowing the identities of the three alleged victims (Victims 1-3) referenced in the indictment, as the alleged misconduct occurred roughly 25 years ago in multiple locations.",
    "The motion claims Ghislaine Maxwell is being held under uniquely harsh conditions at the MDC, including 24-hour surveillance, former suicide watch protocols, and limited access to discovery, which the defense attributes to the circumstances of Jeffrey Epstein's death.",
    "The government's initial discovery production of nearly 13,000 pages did not specifically identify any of Victims 1-3, according to the defense.",
    "The defense states that many alleged victims have already spoken publicly, filed civil suits, and given depositions, undermining government concerns about witness intimidation.",
    "The motion requests Maxwell be released to general population and be granted significantly more time to review discovery, arguing the current proposed 3 hours per day is insufficient for a case with voluminous documents."
