The text is largely garbled with symbols, partial words, and formatting artifacts, making substantive content extraction impossible. It likely documents physical evidence collected during the investigation.",

    "Document is from the Epstein case files, labeled EFTA00003158.",
    "Text is severely corrupted, containing mostly non-alphabetic characters, symbols, and formatting artifacts.",
    "Appears to be a template or log sheet (possibly for photographs or evidence) with fields like 'LOCATION', 'PREPARER/PHOTOGRAPHER', and 'REMARKS'.",
    "No identifiable named individuals, events, dates, or coherent factual claims can be extracted from the visible text.",
    "The garbled nature suggests the file may be a scanned image with poor OCR or is intentionally redacted to the point of being unreadable."
