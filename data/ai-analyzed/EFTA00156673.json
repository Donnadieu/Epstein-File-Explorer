    "Dr. Lisa Rocchio, a forensic psychologist with 30+ years of experience, provides expert testimony on the grooming process, dynamics of child sexual abuse, and common victim behaviors like delayed disclosure and maintaining attachment to abusers.",
    "The testimony discusses how perpetrators often use assistants or other individuals to help groom victims, normalize abusive behavior, and break down defenses, which is relevant to allegations against figures like Maxwell.",
    "Dr. Rocchio confirms she is aware of the Epstein case through media (news, Netflix's 'Filthy Rich', podcasts) and public allegations, but has not interviewed any victims directly.",
    "The expert outlines common psychological impacts of childhood sexual abuse, including PTSD, eating disorders, substance use, and increased risk of re-victimization, providing a framework for understanding victim experiences in the case.",
    "The testimony challenges rape myths, emphasizing that most sexual assault is committed by someone known to the victim and often involves grooming rather than immediate violent attack."
