    "The listed address for the Florida Science Foundation was Jack Goldberger's office suite, but investigations found no signage or tenant knowledge of the foundation at that location.",
    "The note contradicts Epstein's claim of working at the foundation 'every day,' stating he had not been in Palm Beach County in the preceding six months."
