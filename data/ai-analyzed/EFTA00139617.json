It describes that a staff member named Thomas was assigned to staff watch, but the wrong log (I/M companion log) was used instead of the Staff Suicide Watch log. The error was discovered, and a second log was completed using the correct Suicide Watch log, with entries identical in both. The document includes a reference to an Associate Warden and a New York address.",
