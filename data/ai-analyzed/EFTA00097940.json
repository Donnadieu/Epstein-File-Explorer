    "The court found attorney David Markus sufficiently 'associated' with Ghislaine Maxwell's defense to be bound by Local Criminal Rule 23.1, which restricts extrajudicial statements that could prejudice a trial.",
    "Markus had represented Maxwell on appeals of bail denials to the Second Circuit, attended a proceeding, spoken to the press on her behalf, and authored an op-ed describing himself as 'Maxwell's appellate counsel.'",
    "The court clarified that Rule 23.1 applies to lawyers associated with pending litigation, not just those who have formally appeared in the district court case.",
    "The order puts Markus and all lawyers associated with the case on clear notice that their public statements fall under the rule's purview, with potential consequences including attorney discipline.",
    "The Government had moved for the order but did not seek discipline for Markus's prior op-ed, and the court declined to rule on whether it violated the rule due to prior potential lack of clarity."
