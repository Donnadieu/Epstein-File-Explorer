    "Lieutenant Marci Bratton was unaware of the July 30, 2019, email from psychology requiring Jeffrey Epstein to have a cellmate, stating she never saw it due to being overwhelmed with other duties.",

    "Bratton asserts that Epstein should have been placed in the maximum-security unit (10 South) from the beginning due to his high-profile status and prior suicide attempt, as it has cameras in each cell and constant staff monitoring.",
    "During the midnight count on August 10, CO Michael Thomas called in a count of 73 but noted an inmate was in R&D; Bratton instructed him to do a recount for 72, but she never saw a corrected count slip.",
    "Bratton claims the MCC was severely understaffed at the time, with officers working 16+ hour days due to mandatory overtime, impacting the ability to conduct proper counts and rounds and to communicate critical information."
