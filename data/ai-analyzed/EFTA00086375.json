  "summary": "This is a 2017 sealed motion by the U.S. Attorney's Office seeking permission to disclose redacted grand jury materials from the 2006-2007 investigation of Jeffrey Epstein (Operation Leap Year) for use in a civil suit (Jane Doe 2 v. United States). The motion reveals that a witness, represented by attorney James Eisenberg (paid by Epstein), was compelled to testify before a grand jury in 2007. The government argues the sealed materials contradict the witness's later claims in her civil suit. This document is a 'Notice of Filing Privilege Log' submitted by the United States in the case of Jane Does #1 and #2 v. United States. It includes a detailed privilege log listing numerous categories of investigative materials (grand jury subpoenas, search warrants, financial records, victim/witness information, flight manifests, etc.) that the government is withholding from the petitioners, citing privileges such as Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), work product, investigative privilege, and victim privacy rights. The materials are being submitted for in camera review by Judge Kenneth A. Marra. This document is a privilege log from a court filing (Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 212-1) that catalogs evidence and materials related to the federal investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein. It details grand jury materials, victim analyses, draft indictments, legal research, and correspondence, many of which are withheld under various privileges. The log reveals the extensive scope of the 'Operation Leap Year' investigation and the preparation of a federal indictment. This is a 2015 opinion and order from a federal judge in the Southern District of Florida regarding discovery disputes in the case 'Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 v. United States of America.' The case alleges the government violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act by failing to involve victims in the process leading to the non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein. The court rules on various privilege assertions (grand jury secrecy, work product, attorney-client) and relevancy objections over nearly 15,000 pages of documents submitted for in camera review. This is a court order (Document 330) from the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) litigation, where victims are suing the government. The judge rules on discovery disputes, upholding the government's work-product privilege over most documents related to the criminal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and denying victims' requests for FBI files, prosecution memoranda, and materials about alleged improper relationships between prosecutors and Epstein associates. This is a court opinion and order (Document 330) from Judge Kenneth A. Marra in the CVRA litigation (Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM). It rules on discovery disputes, ordering the government to produce certain documents to the petitioners (victims) while upholding privileges like grand jury secrecy and work product for others. The order also addresses the government's obligation to provide victim identities and initial disclosures. This document is pages 35-48 of a court filing (Document 330) from the CVRA litigation case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM, entered on July 6, 2015. It details a privilege log review, ruling on whether specific document ranges (e.g., 3:012654-013226) are protected from discovery by various privileges (attorney-client, opinion work product, grand jury secrecy) or are not relevant to the victims' CVRA claims. It references an OPR investigation into Epstein's allegations of prosecutorial conflicts of interest.",
