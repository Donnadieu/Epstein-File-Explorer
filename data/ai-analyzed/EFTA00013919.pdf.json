    "Jeffrey Epstein was seeking to reduce his sentence ('do less time') from an existing plea deal in May 2008.",
    "The original plea deal was for 2 years, but had been reduced to 18 months, which the email author states was already 'a big break'.",
    "The prosecution had identified more victims since agreeing to the 18-month deal.",
    "Senior officials ('Wand and Alex') had directed that the office was 'not negotiating with this guy any more in any way'.",
    "The email chain shows internal coordination and decision-making within the U.S. Attorney's Office regarding the Epstein case."
