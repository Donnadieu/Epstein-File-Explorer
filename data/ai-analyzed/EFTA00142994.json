    "This is a staff assignment record for the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York, dated August 12, 2019.",
    "The record covers the third quarter of 2019 (July, August, September), specifically detailing assignments from late July to mid-August 2019.",
    "The staff member, Noel, T, was assigned to various posts including Special Housing Units (SHUs), which are typically used for high-security or administrative segregation.",
    "The log shows patterns of sick leave, days off, and overtime worked by the staff member.",
    "The document's date (August 12, 2019) is significant as it falls just days after Jeffrey Epstein's death in custody at the MCC on August 10, 2019, making it a potential record of staff activity around that time."
