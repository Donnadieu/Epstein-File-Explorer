  "summary": "This is a reply memorandum filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team in support of supplemental pretrial motions related to the S2 superseding indictment. It argues that the 2007 Epstein Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) immunizes Maxwell from prosecution on specific counts, that prosecuting her would violate double jeopardy, and that the government is withholding exculpatory Brady material related to a key witness (Accuser-4).",

    "The defense argues the 2007 Epstein Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) immunizes Ghislaine Maxwell from prosecution on Counts One, Three, Five, and Six of the S2 superseding indictment, as she was a 'potential co-conspirator' covered by the agreement.",
    "The defense contends that prosecuting Maxwell on Counts Five and Six violates the Double Jeopardy Clause because Epstein was already punished for those offenses (via the NPA's conditions), and seeking punishment from Maxwell for the same acts constitutes duplicative punishment.",
    "A key witness, Accuser-4, did not mention Ghislaine Maxwell during her initial 2007 FBI interview, which the defense argues is exculpatory Brady material that the government is wrongfully withholding.",
    "The defense frames the SDNY prosecution as a 'do-over' and 'prosecutorial overreach' by an office dissatisfied with the outcome of the earlier Florida investigation and NPA.",
    "The document references that Epstein paid over $12.5 million in settlements to alleged victims, including approximately $446,000 to the person believed to be Accuser-4, as part of fulfilling the NPA conditions."
