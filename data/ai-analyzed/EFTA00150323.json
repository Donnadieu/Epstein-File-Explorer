    "On August 28, 2019, the FBI New York office was actively drafting a public appeal for more victims of Jeffrey Epstein to come forward.",
    "The draft tweet message was debated among FBI personnel, with suggestions to personalize it and directly address victims.",
    "The final suggested tweet text was: 'FBI New York is renewing an appeal for any possible victims of Jeffrey Epstein to call 1-800-CALL-FBI. If you have been victimized by Jeffrey Epstein, we would really like to hear from you.'",
    "The email chain indicates internal FBI coordination on public messaging regarding the Epstein investigation shortly after his death.",
    "The document references that 'a couple victims said they called us after much deliberation,' indicating some victim contact had already occurred."
