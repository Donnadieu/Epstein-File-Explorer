    "The government anticipates producing over 1.2 million documents from electronic devices seized from Jeffrey Epstein's residences, with a target deadline of November 9, 2020.",
    "The defense accused the government of abandoning discovery deadlines and mishandling discovery, which the government strongly denies.",
