    "Prosecutors had discovered 6 new girls and 3 other probable victims in New York, raising serious internal questions about whether Epstein should retain his favorable non-prosecution agreement.",
    "The DOJ's Child Exploitation Obscenity Section (CEOS) was conducting a review of the Epstein matter, with a meeting scheduled for the week of March 31, 2008.",
    "The original agreement required Epstein to plead guilty to state charges by October 26, 2007, but deadlines had been repeatedly postponed.",
    "The correspondence shows internal tension among prosecutors, with one strongly questioning why Epstein should 'keep the same deal after all he has put us through.'",
    "The U.S. Attorney's Office indicated it would extend the compliance deadline to allow for the CEOS review, but if CEOS disagreed with Epstein's position, he would have only one week to comply with the agreement."
