  "summary": "This document is an FBI operation plan and related administrative correspondence detailing the setup of an undercover operation to arrest Alfredo Rodriguez for obstruction of justice. Rodriguez, a former employee of Jeffrey Epstein, attempted to sell subpoenaed documents to attorney Bradley Edwards for $50,000. The FBI planned an undercover evidence purchase and arrest at a Hilton Suites in Boca Raton, Florida. This document set includes FBI interview reports (FD-302s) and operational requests related to Alfredo Rodriguez, a former employee of Jeffrey Epstein. Rodriguez attempted to sell documents related to a civil lawsuit against Epstein to attorney Bradley Edwards for $50,000, leading to an FBI investigation for obstruction of justice. The documents detail interviews, vehicle searches, and requests for undercover operations and electronic monitoring. This document contains an FBI FD-759 form requesting authority for consensual electronic monitoring in an obstruction of justice investigation involving Alfredo Rodriguez, and includes related grand jury subpoenas for telephone records. The monitoring is part of an investigation into Rodriguez's attempt to sell documents related to a civil lawsuit against Jeffrey Epstein to attorney Bradley Edwards. This FBI 302 form documents the issuance of grand jury subpoenas to telecom companies and an interview with Alfredo Rodriguez, former house manager for Jeffrey Epstein. Rodriguez describes being instructed by Ghislaine Maxwell not to discuss activities at Epstein's home, details the seizure of a 'black bound book' and handwritten notes listing girls, and provides extensive testimony about the sexual abuse of underage girls, the roles of Epstein's associates, and the cover-up of evidence. This document set details the FBI's investigation and arrest of Alfredo Rodriguez for obstruction of justice. Rodriguez, a former house manager for Jeffrey Epstein, attempted to sell a 'black book' and handwritten lists containing contact information for alleged victims to attorney Bradley Edwards for $50,000. The documents include Rodriguez's statements about witnessing underage girls, sexual activity, and the operation of Epstein's Palm Beach residence, as well as the undercover sting operation that led to his arrest. This document is a collection of FBI administrative forms and correspondence related to the obstruction of justice case against Alfredo Rodriguez, Jeffrey Epstein's former house manager. It details how Rodriguez attempted to sell an address book containing names and phone numbers of potential underage victims to an undercover employee (UCE) in November 2009. The documents include requests for driver's license information for two California-based individuals found in the book and multiple requests to the FBI's Records Management Division to scan and process telephone records obtained from the address book for investigative use. This document set includes a news article about the sentencing of Alfredo Rodriguez, Epstein's former butler, for obstruction of justice for trying to sell a journal, and internal FBI communications. The FBI memos request interviews with Steven Hoffenberg regarding an alleged murder and with Robert Couturier regarding Epstein's properties and observations of underage girls. This FBI document contains two interview reports and related correspondence. The first details an interview with inmate Steven Hoffenberg, who refused to answer questions about Jeffrey Epstein or the murder of Arthur Shapiro without an attorney. The second, more extensive report details an interview with interior designer Robert Couturier, who describes his interactions with Jeffrey Epstein in 2010 regarding a potential design job for Epstein's homes, his observations of Epstein's behavior and properties, and the social gossip surrounding him. This document contains multiple FBI 302 interview summaries and internal communications related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. It includes an interview with interior designer Robert Couturier about his refusal to work for Epstein, an interview with a victim (name redacted) describing a massage encounter with Epstein, and investigative leads regarding former Epstein employees and a separate homicide investigation of attorney Arthur Shapiro. The document shows FBI efforts to interview potential witnesses and close out investigative leads.",
