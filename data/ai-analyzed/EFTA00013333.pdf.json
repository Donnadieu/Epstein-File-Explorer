    "Judge Engelmayer ordered the U.S. Attorney's Office to explain why Ghislaine Maxwell receives superior discovery and counsel access (13 hours/day laptop, 15 hours/week video) compared to Justin Rivera (3 hours/day laptop, 6 hours/week video).",
    "The justification provided centers on Maxwell being in protective custody at MDC with sole access to a room, while Rivera is in general population at MCC sharing facilities with about 80 other inmates.",
    "Rivera's counsel alleged the disparities were due to race, gender, and class, which the prosecution sought to counter with logistical and case-specific explanations.",
    "The Maxwell case involves 'multiple times more discovery' than the Rivera case, cited as a reason for her greater need for expanded access.",
    "By the time of the correspondence, the MCC had begun leaving a laptop with Rivera all day, only taking it at night to charge, effectively matching Maxwell's electronic access."
