    "Ghislaine Maxwell's defense argues her prosecution violates the 'Epstein Non-Prosecution Agreement' (NPA), which they claim granted her immunity.",
    "The defense draws a direct legal analogy to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's June 30, 2021, decision vacating Bill Cosby's conviction due to a broken prosecutorial promise.",
    "The letter is a formal request to dismiss Counts One, Three, Five, and Six of the S2 Indictment against Maxwell.",
    "The defense emphasizes that the Epstein NPA was a formal written agreement, which they argue makes their case for dismissal even stronger than the informal promise in the Cosby case.",
    "The core legal principle invoked is that prosecutors must abide by their promises, and reneging on such agreements violates due process and fundamental fairness."
