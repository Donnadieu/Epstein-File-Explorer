  "summary": "This is a motion in limine filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team seeking to exclude evidence related to 'Accuser-3' from her criminal trial. The motion argues that Accuser-3 was above the age of consent in the UK (16) during the alleged encounters in 1994-1995, that she cannot establish she was a minor during alleged travel to the US, and therefore her testimony does not prove illegal conduct relevant to the charged Mann Act conspiracies. The defense contends the evidence is inadmissible under Federal Rules of Evidence 404(b) and 403, and alternatively requests limiting instructions.",

    "The defense argues 'Accuser-3' was above the legal age of consent in the United Kingdom (16 years old) during the alleged sexual encounters with Jeffrey Epstein in London in 1994-1995, meaning the alleged acts were not illegal under UK law.",
    "The defense states the government concedes Accuser-3 cannot establish she was a minor (under 18) when she allegedly first traveled to the United States at Epstein and Maxwell's invitation, or when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in the US.",
    "The motion claims the government originally included Accuser-3's allegations in the indictment under the mistaken belief she was a minor, and repeated this error in the S2 Superseding Indictment after the defense pointed out the age-of-consent issue.",
    "The defense seeks to preclude the government and Accuser-3 from referring to her as a 'minor' or stating she was 'sexually abused' by Epstein, arguing these terms are misleading and prejudicial as the alleged conduct was legal.",
    "If the evidence is admitted, the defense requests a limiting instruction informing the jury that the alleged sexual activity in London was not illegal under UK law and cannot be considered 'illegal,' 'criminal,' or 'unlawful' for the purposes of the charged crimes."
