    "The federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein began in 2006 based on a request from the Palm Beach Police Department, focusing on the use of interstate facilities to induce minors into prostitution.",
    "A non-prosecution agreement was reached between Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office in September 2007, deferring federal prosecution to the State of Florida while preserving victims' rights to sue under federal law (18 U.S.C. § 2255).",
    "Victim T.M. was represented by attorney James Eisenberg, whose fees were paid by Jeffrey Epstein, the target of the investigation, creating a potential conflict of interest.",
    "The AUSA states that victim T.M. was 'openly hostile to the prosecution of Epstein' in 2007 and, due to her prior statements, could not in good faith be included as a victim in a potential federal indictment.",
    "The declaration reveals that victims were not consulted prior to the 2007 non-prosecution agreement, and Epstein's attorneys complained when victims were notified, fearing it would incentivize them to overstate claims for damages."
