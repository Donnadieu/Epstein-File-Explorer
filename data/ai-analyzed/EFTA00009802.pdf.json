  "keyFacts": [
    "Prosecutors state the FBI is 'completely fucking us' on processing over 60 devices seized from Epstein's properties.",
    "Over 1 million documents were received but are unusable because emails cannot be linked to their attachments (e.g., 'see the attached flight records' is unverifiable).",
    "Nine IDE hard drives from Epstein's Manhattan apartment were copies of drives seized in a July 2007 search of another property.",
    "Evidence was seized from two primary locations: Epstein's New York mansion (approx. 40+ devices and 60+ CDs) and his Virgin Islands property (over 25 devices including servers).",
    "The data transfer lacked basic organization: load files didn't match native files, making large files 'completely invisible' for review and future production to defense counsel."
