  "summary": "This is the en banc Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in the case of In re Wild, which denied a petition for a writ of mandamus. The petitioner, Courtney Wild, an alleged victim of Jeffrey Epstein, sought to enforce her rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) against the U.S. government for entering into a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein without conferring with her. The court held that the CVRA does not create a private right of action authorizing a crime victim to file a stand-alone civil lawsuit to enforce CVRA rights before the commencement of, or in the absence of, any preexisting criminal proceeding.",

    "The Eleventh Circuit held that the Crime Victims' Rights Act does not create a private right of action allowing a crime victim to file a stand-alone civil lawsuit to enforce CVRA rights before criminal proceedings begin.",
    "The court found that the CVRA's remedy of a 'motion for relief' presupposes a preexisting criminal proceeding and cannot initiate a new, freestanding civil action.",
    "The government violated Epstein victims' CVRA rights by secretly negotiating and executing a non-prosecution agreement without conferring with them and by actively misleading them about the status of the investigation.",
    "Jeffrey Epstein's non-prosecution agreement, signed in September 2007, granted him and his co-conspirators immunity from federal prosecution in exchange for pleading guilty to state charges.",
    "The dissenting judges argued that the CVRA's plain text grants victims pre-charge rights to confer and be treated fairly, and provides a private remedy via a motion for relief when 'no prosecution is underway.'"
