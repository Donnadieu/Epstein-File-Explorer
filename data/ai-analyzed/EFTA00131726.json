  "dateOriginal": "2019-08-23 to 2020-09-17",
  "summary": "This document set contains FBI interview reports (FD-302s) with Bureau of Prisons correctional officers regarding the discovery of Jeffrey Epstein's death on August 10, 2019, and subsequent FBI Laboratory records concerning a request for handwriting analysis on a letter possibly written by Epstein. The interviews detail the immediate response to the incident and the officers' roles, while the lab records show the FBI was unable to conclusively analyze handwriting due to a lack of verified known samples. This is an FBI Laboratory case note detailing a questioned documents examination related to Lab #2020-01577-1. The examination analyzes various documents submitted as purported known writing of Jeffrey Epstein and items addressed to Larry Nassar, assessing their suitability for handwriting comparison and analyzing indented writing. This document is a collection of Bureau of Prisons records related to Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) New York in July 2019, including his housing status, commissary list, an incident report of an attempted hanging, and related disciplinary forms. It also includes an FBI Laboratory case report and communication log regarding the examination of documents possibly linked to Epstein. This document consists of two parts: a series of screenshots from a furniture website (Artefacto) dated September 8, 2014, and an email exchange from August 11, 2020, between an FBI Special Agent and a Document Analyst regarding the submission and processing of evidence under case NY-3151227/Lab #2020-01577. The email discusses the shipment of evidence to the FBI Laboratory's Questioned Documents Unit. This document is an FBI Laboratory report and related email correspondence regarding a handwriting analysis request (Lab #2020-01577). The FBI's Questioned Documents Unit was asked to determine if a letter addressed to Larry Nassar, found as 'return to sender' from Jeffrey Epstein's cell, was written by Epstein. The examiner concluded meaningful comparisons could not be made due to a lack of verified, comparable known handwriting samples from Epstein. This document is a compilation of FBI records related to the death investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. It includes an interview with a Bureau of Prisons camera technician about the malfunctioning video system at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) on the day of Epstein's death, an investigation into a threat against former MCC guard Tova Noel, and logs related to the collection and examination of digital evidence (DVR hard drives) from the MCC. This document contains an FBI Digital Forensics Analysis Unit (DFAU) report detailing the forensic examination of a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) system, likely from a property associated with Jeffrey Epstein. The report describes attempts to recover video data, hardware failures, and the creation of forensic copies. It is followed by email correspondence regarding evidence custody with the OCME (Office of the Chief Medical Examiner) and a deferred prosecution agreement for two individuals. This document contains two deferred prosecution agreements filed in the same criminal case (1:19-cr-00830-AT). The agreements are for defendants Michael Thomas and Tova Noel, both Bureau of Prisons employees accused of falsifying count and round slips at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on August 9-10, 2019. The agreements outline conditions for deferring prosecution, including cooperation with investigations and community service. This document is a compilation of FBI records related to the death investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, focusing on evidence handling. It includes a judge's approval of a deferred prosecution agreement for correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, multiple FBI Electronic Communications detailing the release and return of evidence to the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), extensive evidence chain of custody forms (FD-1004), property receipts (FD-597), and internal emails. The records document the transfer of digital evidence (hard drives, DVRs) and physical evidence from the FBI to OIG, the subsequent return of some items, and the eventual closure of the investigation after determining the death was a suicide.",
