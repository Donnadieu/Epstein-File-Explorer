  "summary": "This document is a court filing from the civil case Jane Doe No. 2 v. Jeffrey Epstein, specifically the plaintiffs' reply in support of a motion to compel the FBI to produce sworn statements given by the plaintiffs (Jane Does 2-7) during the FBI's investigation of Epstein. It includes the motion, an affidavit from an attorney detailing her communications with the FBI, and a letter from FBI counsel outlining the Privacy Act requirements for releasing the statements. This document is a collection of filings and correspondence from the civil case Jane Doe 2-7 v. Jeffrey Epstein. It centers on the plaintiffs' motion to compel the FBI to produce sworn statements the plaintiffs gave during the FBI's criminal investigation of Epstein. The documents include the motion, a reply, affidavits, fax cover sheets, and internal emails between the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office discussing the subpoena and the FBI's position that a court order or notarized consent is required under the Privacy Act. This document is a motion filed by plaintiffs Jane Doe Nos. 2-7 in civil lawsuits against Jeffrey Epstein, seeking to compel the FBI to release the plaintiffs' own sworn statements given during the FBI's criminal investigation of Epstein. It includes the motion, a subpoena, a proposed order, and related correspondence showing the FBI initially stated no responsive records were found. This document is a subpoena and related correspondence from the civil case 'Jane Does 2-7 v. Jeffrey Epstein' (Case No. 08-CV-80119). It includes a subpoena issued to the FBI's Records Custodian to produce sworn statements from six individuals (with redacted names but listed DOBs) taken during the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. The FBI's response, via a letter from Chief Division Counsel, cites regulations (28 CFR 16.21 et seq. and the Privacy Act) requiring a court order or notarized consent before releasing the requested records. Internal FBI notes document the receipt and handling of the subpoena.",
