    "Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide on August 10, 2019, while in pretrial custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York.",
    "The reconstruction was severely limited because the FBI had confiscated the original video footage and formal interviews were not conducted to avoid interfering with pending DOJ investigations.",
    "On July 23, 2019, Epstein was found with a cloth around his neck but denied a suicide attempt, claiming his cellmate had tried to kill him. He was placed on suicide watch for 31 hours.",
    "On the night of his death, Epstein was single-celled because his cellmate did not return from court, and staff failed to complete proper 30-minute rounds at 3:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.",
    "The report notes that on August 9, 2019, the day before his death, approximately 2,000 pages of court documents were unsealed, containing graphic allegations and naming associates like Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "There were significant inconsistencies in the documentation of the scene when Epstein was found unresponsive on July 23, 2019, with one report mentioning a \"string\" and another a \"piece of handmade orange cloth\" around his neck.",
    "Critical procedural failures occurred, including a lack of direct, continuous observation during Epstein's suicide watch and extended attorney visits, and failure to follow up on early concerns about his mental state.",
    "Multiple documentation errors were found: incorrect data in psychology intake forms, inaccurate suicide watch logs that were improperly altered by staff, and inconsistent inmate housing assignments in the SENTRY system.",
    "Epstein was allowed to make an unmonitored telephone call on August 9, 2019, where he claimed to be calling his mother (who died in 2004), with a staff member dialing a number with area code 347.",
    "The report indicates a systemic lack of control and accuracy in record-keeping, including unsecured attorney log books after Epstein's death and incomplete staff training records."
