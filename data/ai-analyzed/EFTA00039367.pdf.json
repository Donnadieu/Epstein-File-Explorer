    "Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide on August 10, 2019, while in pretrial custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York.",
    "The reconstruction was severely limited because the FBI had confiscated the original video footage and formal interviews were not conducted to avoid interfering with other DOJ investigations.",
    "On July 23, 2019, Epstein was found with a cloth around his neck in an incident staff could not definitively classify as an assault or a suicide attempt; he was placed on suicide watch for 31 hours.",
    "On the night of his death, Epstein was single-celled because his cellmate did not return from court, and staff failed to assign him a new cellmate despite communication about the need.",
    "Correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas admitted they did not complete the required 30-minute rounds at 3:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. on the morning Epstein died.",
    "Significant inconsistencies exist in the documentation of the scene where Epstein was found unresponsive on July 23, 2019, with different descriptions of the object around his neck.",
    "Critical failures in suicide watch protocol occurred, including a correctional officer using the wrong log book and another staff member falsifying entries by copying and initialing them, obscuring who was actually monitoring Epstein.",
    "Epstein received extensive, unmonitored attorney visits (often over 10 hours per day) while on psychological observation, during which required 'direct, continuous observation' by BOP staff was not maintained.",
    "Epstein was allowed to make an unmonitored telephone call on August 9, 2019, where he claimed to be calling his deceased mother, highlighting a breakdown in controlled communication procedures.",
    "The report identifies systemic issues with record-keeping at MCC NY, including inaccurate inmate cell assignments in the SENTRY system, unsecured attorney log books after Epstein's death, and numerous incomplete or erroneous official forms."
