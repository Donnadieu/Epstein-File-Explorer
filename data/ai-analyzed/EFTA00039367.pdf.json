    "Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide on August 10, 2019, while in federal custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York.",
    "The reconstruction report notes the absence of key evidence, including video footage confiscated by the FBI and the inability to conduct formal interviews due to pending DOJ investigations.",
    "Epstein had a prior incident on July 23, 2019, where he was found with a cloth around his neck; he denied it was a suicide attempt and claimed his cellmate tried to kill him.",
    "On the night of his death, Epstein was single-celled because his cellmate did not return from court, and staff failed to complete required 30-minute rounds at 3:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.",
    "The report concludes that factors contributing to Epstein's suicide included the loss of his status, lack of deep interpersonal connections, and the prospect of life in prison.",
    "There were significant inconsistencies in the documentation of the scene when Epstein was found unresponsive on July 23, 2019, with one report mentioning a \"string\" and another a \"piece of handmade orange cloth\" around his neck.",
    "Critical procedural failures occurred, including a lack of continuous observation during Epstein's suicide watch, especially during marathon attorney visits totaling over 60 hours in one week.",
    "Record-keeping was severely flawed: suicide watch logs were improperly altered, inmate housing assignments in SENTRY were inaccurate, and attorney log books were unsecured and contained numerous errors after Epstein's death.",
    "Epstein was allowed to make an unmonitored phone call on August 9, 2019, where a staff member dialed a number for him (area code 347) after he claimed he was calling his deceased mother.",
    "The report highlights a systemic lack of understanding and management of sex-offender risk factors among staff and multiple instances where psychological protocols and alerts were not followed."
