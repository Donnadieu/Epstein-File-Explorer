    "Scott Borgerson, a Massachusetts resident and former CEO, had a close personal relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell from 2013 onward, living together from at least 2015.",
    "Borgerson asserts Maxwell had nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein's crimes and that he himself never met or communicated with Epstein.",
    "Intense media harassment following Epstein's 2019 arrest and death forced Maxwell to leave Massachusetts; Borgerson assisted in purchasing a New Hampshire property to shield her and his family from the media, not to evade law enforcement.",
    "The media frenzy caused Borgerson to resign as CEO of his company because his association with Maxwell became a distraction.",
    "Borgerson believes Maxwell intends to remain in the United States to face trial and clear her name, which is why she chose to live in New Hampshire—to be close to New York."
