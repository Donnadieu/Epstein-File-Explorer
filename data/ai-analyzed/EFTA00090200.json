  "summary": "This is a memorandum opinion and order by Judge Alison J. Nathan in the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal case, ruling on Maxwell's motion to exclude testimony from a witness referred to as Witness-3. The court allows limited testimony from Witness-3 regarding her interactions with Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein as direct evidence for Mann Act counts and for permissible purposes under Rule 404(b), but imposes strict limitations to prevent unfair prejudice. This is a transcript of a pre-trial hearing in a criminal case (Case 1:20-cr-00084-AJN). The defense attorney, Mr. DeMarco, objects to the anticipated testimony of witness Rasheen Vega, arguing that his graphic descriptions of the victim's injuries would be unduly prejudicial. The judge sets limits on the testimony, balancing its probative value against the risk of unfair prejudice.",

    "The testimony is limited: Witness-3 can state sexual activity occurred but cannot provide detailed descriptions, subjective experiences, or emotional impact, to minimize unfair prejudice under Rule 403.",
    "The Government acknowledged that Witness-3 is not a victim of the crimes charged in the indictment, as she was over the age of consent, and may not be referred to as a 'victim' or 'minor victim' in front of the jury.",
    "The court precluded Witness-3's testimony as it relates to the sex trafficking counts, finding its probative value substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice due to remoteness in time.",
    "The court attached a proposed limiting instruction to be read to the jury, clarifying that the sexual conduct described by Witness-3 was not illegal for the purposes of the charged crimes and cannot form the basis for a conviction.",
    "The case involves a 2000 shooting where the victim, Mr. Jones, was paralyzed and died in 2010 from related complications.",

    "The judge allows the testimony but imposes strict limits to prevent overly emotional or cumulative descriptions that could unfairly prejudice the jury against the defendant, Mr. Berry.",
