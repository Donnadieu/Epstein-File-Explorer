  "keyFacts": [
    "The court denied Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4's attempt to join a CVRA lawsuit, finding their participation as named parties unnecessary since they could serve as fact witnesses for the existing 'similarly-situated victims' claim.",
    "The court ordered large portions of Jane Doe 3's allegations—which detailed her being trafficked by Epstein to 'prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders'—stricken from the record as 'immaterial and impertinent' to the core CVRA claim.",
    "Alan Dershowitz's motion to intervene to strike allegations against him was denied as moot because the court had already struck the offending material on its own authority under Rule 12(f).",
    "The court noted the Government's argument that Jane Doe 4 might not be a proper party because she was not a 'known victim' at the time of the NPA and thus may not have CVRA standing.",
    "The underlying lawsuit alleges the U.S. Government violated victims' rights under the CVRA by concealing and failing to consult with them before negotiating a non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein."
