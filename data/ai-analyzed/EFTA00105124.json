  "summary": "This is a Federal Bureau of Prisons investigative report concerning an incident on July 23, 2019, where inmate Jeffrey Epstein was found in his cell with a homemade noose around his neck. The report details the incident, subsequent medical assessments, and interviews with Epstein and his cellmate, Nicholas Tartaglione, concluding there was insufficient evidence of assault and no need for a separation order. This document is a Bureau of Prisons Form 583 Report of Incident and accompanying staff memoranda detailing the events of July 23, 2019, at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, where inmate Jeffrey Epstein was found with an orange cloth around his neck. The reports describe the response, Epstein's subsequent allegations against his cellmate, and the conflicting accounts of whether it was a suicide attempt or an assault. This document contains Bureau of Prisons records from July 23, 2019, detailing the incident where Jeffrey Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell with a rope around his neck. It includes staff shift logs, a clinical encounter report, photo sheets documenting the scene and his cellmate, an administrative detention order, and an incident report. The records show Epstein was placed on suicide watch and treated for neck injuries.",
