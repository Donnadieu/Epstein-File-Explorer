  "summary": "This is an email chain from August 2019 discussing the probate of Jeffrey Epstein's estate following his death. The emails reveal that Epstein's attorneys, Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, are the executors, that Epstein updated his will and established a trust (the \"1953 Trust\") the day before his death, and that the assets flow to unnamed trustees of that trust. The correspondents express outrage and note the apparent contradiction between the attorneys questioning the suicide ruling and Epstein's estate planning just prior to death.",
