    "The document is an internal email from October 4, 2019, within the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.",
    "The subject line 'FW: Request' and the text 'Other than Epstein, we would have' suggests this communication is part of a broader context, possibly related to the Epstein investigation, though the main request is about general human trafficking victim data.",
    "An Assistant U.S. Attorney, serving as a Human Trafficking Co-Coordinator, is soliciting information from various units to understand the volume of human trafficking victim interviews conducted.",
    "The request emphasizes that the data should include all victims, regardless of whether the case was charged, and acknowledges that some units may have zero cases.",
    "The document's file number (EFTA00013175) and its inclusion in the Epstein case data set indicate it is part of the released materials related to the investigation, though its direct connection to Epstein is not detailed in the provided text."
