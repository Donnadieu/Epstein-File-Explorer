    "The FBI was actively investigating Ghislaine Maxwell in early 2020, issuing a subpoena (dated January 27, 2020, per an attachment) to a company, likely Expedia, for records.",
    "The company could not locate records using only a name and date of birth; they required specific identifiers like email addresses, credit card numbers, or itinerary numbers to search their databases.",
    "The FBI agent provided at least one additional email address for the search on February 12, 2020, but the company found no records associated with it.",
    "Due to the FBI not providing sufficient identifying information within 30 days, the company closed the investigative request on March 17, 2020.",
    "The communication highlights a practical challenge in digital investigations: companies often need very specific digital footprints (emails, payment info) to retrieve records, not just names."
