    "A grand jury subpoena (CRIM1031692) was issued to Amazon.com as part of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, seeking records related to 'expressive materials' shipped to or billed at specific addresses.",
    "Amazon's legal team, led by Jeffrey Goldberg, raised significant First Amendment concerns, citing case law that protects bookstore and library records from government compulsion without a heightened showing of relevance and need.",
    "Jeffrey Epstein's death was cited as a potential factor that might affect whether the subjects of the subpoena retained a protectable privacy interest in their Amazon purchase records.",
    "Amazon indicated it might file a motion to quash the subpoena if the government decided to pursue the records, but also stated it was preserving responsive information and not ruling out that sufficient grounds to compel production might exist.",
    "The correspondence reveals the investigation sought information on all Amazon accounts that had ever shipped to or billed in connection with a list of addresses, which Amazon argued was overbroad."
