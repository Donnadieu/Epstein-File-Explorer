    "Forensic examiners were actively processing multiple Mac computers (e.g., NYC024328, NYC024329, NYC024353) seized in the Epstein investigation as of October 2020 to extract image and video files.",
    "Device NYC024342 was identified as a wiped drive with no data recoverable, indicating potential evidence destruction.",
    "The forensic process was described as going 'very slowly' due to equipment constraints, with examiners stacked up waiting for processing machines.",
    "The email chain shows ongoing coordination between the U.S. Attorney's Office and forensic examiners well over a year after Epstein's death, indicating an active investigation into evidence from his devices."
