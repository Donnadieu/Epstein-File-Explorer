    "Jeffrey Epstein's defense team filed a motion to keep his supplemental financial disclosure sealed, arguing public disclosure would violate the Bail Reform Act's confidentiality requirements.",
    "The motion states Epstein had not yet provided a complete financial disclosure in his bail submission 'on advice of counsel' to ensure accuracy and completeness.",
    "Epstein's attorneys argued that the 'exceptional amount of publicity' about his finances meant public filing would lead to widespread media dissemination, contravening statutory confidentiality.",
    "The motion was signed by three defense attorneys: Reid Weingarten, Martin G. Weinberg, and Marc Allan Fernich.",
    "The document reveals ongoing legal maneuvering in July 2019 regarding Epstein's financial transparency while he was facing criminal charges."
