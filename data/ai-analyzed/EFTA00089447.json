    "French attorney William Julie argues that France has discretion to extradite its citizens to the U.S. under the U.S.-France Extradition Treaty and EU-U.S. Agreement.",
    "The document critiques the U.S. government's reliance on the 2007 Peterson case, noting it was a discretionary ministerial decision, not a binding judicial precedent.",
    "Julie contends that Article 3 of the U.S.-France Extradition Treaty does not preclude extradition of French nationals; it merely states there is no obligation to do so.",
    "The analysis emphasizes that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international treaties prevail over national legislation on extradition matters.",
    "The opinion concludes it is 'highly unlikely' France would refuse to extradite Ghislaine Maxwell, especially if she signed an irrevocable waiver in the U.S."
