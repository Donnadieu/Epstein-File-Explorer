  "summary": "A letter from defense attorney Gerald B. Lefcourt to a federal prosecutor, transmitting highlighted excerpts and full transcripts of witness interviews from the state investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The letter argues the evidence shows no federal crime occurred and attempts to restrict the government's use of the draft transcripts. This document is a transcript of a videotaped interview, likely with a witness or victim, conducted by a detective as part of the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The interviewee describes being recruited to give massages to Epstein, the nature of the massages, financial arrangements, and their role in recruiting other young women, including a minor. This document contains draft transcripts of police interviews with multiple young women/victims regarding their experiences at Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach residence. The interviews detail recruitment by a friend, the promise of money for massages, and escalating sexual demands by Epstein, including requests for nudity and touching. The victims describe being minors (16-17 years old) at the time of the incidents.",

    "Epstein's defense team provided the prosecution with draft transcripts of witness interviews from the state investigation, arguing the evidence shows no federal crime.",

    "The defense attempts to restrict the government's use of the draft transcripts, stating they are provided as a courtesy and are not usable for any purposes, and the government must agree not to use revisions against Epstein.",
    "Attached interview excerpts contain denials from witnesses about specific sexual acts with Epstein, but also contain statements like 'the younger the better' attributed to Epstein and discussions of girls lying about their age.",
    "The witness was 18-20 years old during her interactions with Jeffrey Epstein and was paid $300 for massage sessions.",
    "Epstein had a rule that girls brought to his house must know what they were \"getting into\" beforehand, which involved sexual expectations beyond a massage.",
    "The witness recruited other girls for Epstein, including a 16-year-old, and received more money for bringing them.",
    "During massages, the witness was sometimes only in her underwear, and Epstein touched her hip, buttocks, and tried to touch her under her clothes.",
    "The witness describes Epstein's behavior as not forcing her but trying to talk her into more, and he would stop if she said she was uncomfortable.",
    "Multiple underage girls (aged 16-17 at the time) were recruited by a friend and paid by Jeffrey Epstein for 'massages' at his Palm Beach residence.",
    "The recruitment process involved the friend being paid $300-$400 by Epstein for bringing new girls, and the victims being paid $200 per visit.",
    "The massages involved escalating demands: initially described as just a massage, but with expectations to remove clothing (topless, then potentially more) and endure sexual touching.",
    "Victims describe being scared, uncomfortable, and aware that the situation was not normal, with one stating she stopped going because Epstein 'kind of scared me.'",
    "The police detective indicates he has interviewed 'a lot of girls' about similar experiences at Epstein's house, suggesting a pattern of behavior."
