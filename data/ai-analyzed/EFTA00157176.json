  "summary": "This document is a chain of emails from June 2020 between personnel at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (USANYS) and FBI forensic examiners (NY CART). The emails discuss significant delays and logistical challenges in processing, transferring, and reviewing terabytes of digital evidence seized from Jeffrey Epstein's properties in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The correspondence reveals technical issues with data formats, staffing shortages, and the complexity of handling evidence from numerous devices. This document is an email chain from February 2020 discussing the logistical challenges of processing and tracking the massive volume of digital evidence seized from Jeffrey Epstein's properties in New York and the Virgin Islands. It highlights the scale of the evidence (over a million documents, dozens of devices) and the lack of organization in the data transfers, prompting a request for a coordinated meeting and a tracking system.",
