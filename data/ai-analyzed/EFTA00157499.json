    "The FBI's Computer Analysis Response Team (CART) was processing terabytes of digital evidence seized from Epstein's properties in New York and the US Virgin Islands, including phones, tablets, media, cameras, DVRs, servers, and computers.",
    "Significant problems were reported with over 1 million previously produced documents, including an inability to link emails to their attachments and mismatched load files that made review and future production to defense counsel difficult.",
    "Evidence seized included 9 IDE hard drives from Epstein's Manhattan apartment, which were determined to be 3 copies of 3 drives from a July 2007 search of one of his properties.",
    "The U.S. Attorney's Office required evidence in a specific format loadable onto the Relativity database for taint review and discovery purposes, which the FBI noted added months of work and was incapable of viewing all forensic data.",
    "Processing was delayed due to reduced staffing levels (down to one day a week for some personnel) and the logistical challenges of transferring massive amounts of data during the COVID-19 pandemic period.",
    "Digital evidence from Epstein search warrants included approximately 40+ devices from a New York mansion and 25+ devices from the Virgin Islands, including servers.",
    "The FBI was processing over a million documents from the seized devices, indicating the massive scale of the digital evidence collection.",
    "Coordination issues existed between the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI regarding tracking which devices had been examined and which data had been transferred.",
    "Evidence from the New York search included Windows-based items, loose media, and CDs containing only pictures (no documents), with some Apple items still pending production."
