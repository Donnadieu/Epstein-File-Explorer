    "Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in his cell at MCC New York on August 10, 2019, while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.",
    "The report identifies multiple serious procedural failures: Epstein was left single-celled the night he died despite policy; 30-minute rounds were not completed; SENTRY inmate housing assignments were inaccurate; and documentation was riddled with errors.",
    "On July 23, 2019, Epstein was found with a cloth around his neck in an incident initially reported as self-mutilation. He claimed his cellmate, Nicholas Tartaglione, tried to kill him, but an investigation was inconclusive.",
    "The report states that key evidence was unavailable: the FBI had confiscated the original video footage, and formal interviews were not conducted to avoid interfering with other DOJ investigations.",
    "On August 9, 2019, the day before his death, approximately 2,000 pages of court documents were unsealed, containing damaging allegations and naming associates, which the report suggests eroded Epstein's status."
