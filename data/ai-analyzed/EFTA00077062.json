    "The SDNY possesses FBI investigative files from the SDFL Epstein investigation but deliberately avoided obtaining any files from the SDFL U.S. Attorney's Office to avoid conflict and discovery issues.",
    "NDGA has stepped into the shoes of SDFL for Epstein-related matters, and victims may be directed to submit document requests there.",
    "Internal debate centered on whether SDNY, as the district where the civil action was filed, was the 'responsible' USA for Touhy requests regarding the SDFL investigation materials.",
    "The office cited the law enforcement privilege and ongoing investigation as reasons for not producing certain additional materials sought by victims' counsel."
