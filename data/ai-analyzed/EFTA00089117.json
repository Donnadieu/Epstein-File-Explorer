  "summary": "A series of Bureau of Prisons clinical psychology notes documenting daily mental status evaluations of inmate Jeffrey Epstein from July 27 to August 1, 2019, while he was on psychological observation following an incident involving marks on his neck. The notes detail his complaints about sleep, noise in the SHU, physical symptoms, and his consistent denial of suicidal ideation. This document contains two Bureau of Prisons psychological assessment reports for Jeffrey Epstein, dated August 1 and August 8, 2019, while he was incarcerated at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) New York. The reports assess his suicide risk, mental status, and protective factors following an incident where he was found with a string around his neck. The psychologist concludes his acute suicide risk is low and no suicide watch is warranted.",
