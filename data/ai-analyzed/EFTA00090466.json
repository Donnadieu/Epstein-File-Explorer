    "Accuser 4 was first contacted by the FBI in 2007 and interviewed on August 7, 2007, but did not identify Ghislaine Maxwell at that time.",
    "Accuser 4 filed lawsuits against Jeffrey Epstein that did not mention Ghislaine Maxwell, and during a deposition for those lawsuits, still did not identify Maxwell.",
    "On June 23, 2021, the government presented Accuser 4 with a photo array that included Maxwell, which the defense argues was unduly suggestive and equivalent to a one-on-one show-up.",
    "The defense motion argues that any identification of Maxwell by Accuser 4 should be suppressed due to the suggestive nature of the photo array and lack of prior identification over nearly 20 years.",
    "The motion cites multiple legal precedents regarding due process rights and suggestive identification procedures, including Simmons v. United States and Neil v. Biggers."
