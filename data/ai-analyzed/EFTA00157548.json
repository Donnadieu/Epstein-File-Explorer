  "summary": "This is a videotaped deposition transcript of Juan Alessi, a former employee of Jeffrey Epstein, taken in the civil case Jane Doe No. 2 v. Jeffrey Epstein. Alessi describes his employment history, duties, and observations at Epstein's Palm Beach residence, including the arrival of Ghislaine Maxwell, the presence of young female visitors, and the existence of nude photographs. This document is a deposition transcript of a witness (likely Alfredo Rodriguez or a similar staff member) who worked for Jeffrey Epstein. The witness describes his duties, including arranging and sometimes transporting massage therapists to Epstein's Palm Beach house, maintaining a Rolodex of contacts, and handling payments. He discusses the frequency of female visitors, their origins (often European), payment methods, and denies knowledge of any being underage, though he identifies one specific young woman from a photograph. This document is a transcript of a deposition or sworn testimony from a former employee (likely a butler or house manager) of Jeffrey Epstein. The witness describes the layout of Epstein's Palm Beach house, the roles of Ghislaine Maxwell and others, the recruitment of massage therapists, and the presence of various guests and associates. This document is a transcript from the September 8, 2009 deposition of Juan Alessi, a former employee of Jeffrey Epstein. Alessi describes his duties, the high-profile visitors to Epstein's Palm Beach residence, and details about the massage routines and sexual paraphernalia found in the house. The testimony provides insights into the social circle and activities at the property.",
