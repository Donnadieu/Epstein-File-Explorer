  "keyFacts": [
    "The court denied Ghislaine Maxwell's request for a broad exception to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who had made any public statement 'relating to' her or Jeffrey Epstein, finding the exception too broad and protective of privacy interests.",
    "The court adopted the Government's language allowing Maxwell to publicly reference only individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this specific case.",
    "The court denied Maxwell's unprecedented request to restrict potential Government witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial, citing existing legal restrictions on the Government and lack of demonstrated need.",
    "The protective order dispute highlights the tension between the defense's investigative/preparatory needs and the privacy protections for alleged victims and witnesses in a high-profile case."
