    "These are routine prison administrative documents (count sheets, rosters, out-count forms) from the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York for August 5-6, 2019.",
    "The inmate rosters list several individuals, including Gama-Pineda, Torres, Bullock, Walker, and Harrison, with their registration numbers and assignments (e.g., hospital, suicide watch, transport driver).",
    "Multiple inmates (Bullock, Walker, Gama-Pineda, Torres) are noted as being on 'SUICIDE OR UNASSG' status, indicating they were under suicide watch or had no work assignment.",
    "The documents show the standard operational procedure for inmate population management, including verifying counts by housing unit (B-A, C-A, E-N, etc.) and preparing out-count forms.",
    "The dates (August 5-6, 2019) place these records shortly before Jeffrey Epstein's death in the same facility on August 10, 2019, though he is not explicitly named in these specific pages."
