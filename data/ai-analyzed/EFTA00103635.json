    "The documents are investigative worksheets used to track leads from a hotline, indicating a systematic effort to gather information from potential witnesses or victims.",
    "The forms consistently ask if the interviewee was a 'victim', how they knew 'him', and details about their first meeting, strongly suggesting the subject of the investigation is Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "The dates on the worksheets are primarily from July 2019, coinciding with Epstein's arrest and the subsequent public call for information.",
    "The majority of the handwritten entries are illegible, redacted, or contain minimal information, limiting specific factual extraction.",
    "The existence of these standardized forms indicates a formal process for vetting tips and conducting follow-up interviews in the Epstein case."
