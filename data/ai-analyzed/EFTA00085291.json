  "summary": "This document is a transcript of FBI Special Agent testifying before a federal grand jury in West Palm Beach on February 6, 2007, regarding the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein for sex trafficking of minors. The agent details the origins of the investigation, Epstein's assets, the roles of his assistants in scheduling underage girls for sexual massages, the evidence collected via subpoenas, and the nature of the abuse. This document is a transcript of FBI testimony before a grand jury regarding the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The testimony details the initial report in March 2005 by a 14-year-old victim, the subsequent events of February 5-6, 2005, involving a massage at Epstein's Palm Beach residence that escalated to sexual abuse, and discrepancies in the victim's statements over time. This document is a segment of a grand jury transcript where a witness, likely a law enforcement officer, is being questioned about phone call evidence, trash pulls at Jeffrey Epstein's house, and testimony regarding Epstein's interactions with underage girls. It includes discussions about recruitment methods and evidence of Epstein's knowledge of victims' ages. This document contains transcripts of federal grand jury proceedings in West Palm Beach, Florida, related to 'Operation Leap Year' and the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. It includes testimony from an FBI Special Agent detailing the recruitment and sexual abuse of underage girls, and the testimony of a witness (referred to as 'Jane Doe 102') who describes being recruited, performing a massage for Epstein, and subsequently recruiting other minor girls for him. The document reveals patterns of abuse, payment, and recruitment. This document is a transcript of grand jury testimony by a special agent detailing sexual abuse allegations against Jeffrey Epstein involving multiple minor victims (Jane Does 14-17, 7, and 8). The testimony includes descriptions of sexual acts, evidence of phone and message pad records, payments, and Epstein's knowledge of the victims' ages. It also references state charges against Epstein for solicitation of prostitution that did not mention the victims were minors. This document is a transcript of FBI Special Agent testimony before a federal grand jury in West Palm Beach on May 8, 2007, as part of Operation Leap Year. The agent details interviews with a minor victim (referred to as 'Miss [REDACTED]') who described performing topless massages for Jeffrey Epstein starting at age 15, Epstein's grooming techniques, and the involvement of his assistants in scheduling appointments. The testimony also covers expert analysis on 'compliant victims' and the structure of Epstein's companies. This is a transcript of FBI Special Agent [REDACTED] testifying before a federal grand jury (Operation Leap Year) on May 8, 2007.
