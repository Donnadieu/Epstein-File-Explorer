    "The communication centers on managing digital evidence for the Ghislaine Maxwell case, specifically uploading materials to the Relativity platform.",
    "Multiple devices are referenced by NYC evidence numbers (e.g., NYC024332, NYC024369, NYC027913), indicating a large volume of seized digital material.",
    "There are issues with evidence completeness, including a missing device (NYC027913), duplicate folders, and approximately 71,000 zero-byte (empty) files in initial extractions.",
    "Some devices (e.g., servers with multiple drives) are noted as physically failed and require specialized hardware recovery, which is described as a potentially long and uncertain process.",
    "The emails show a back-and-forth between legal/technical teams to verify inventory and ensure all discovery materials are processed correctly."
