    "On August 12, 2019, two days after Jeffrey Epstein's death in custody, correctional officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas had their duties reassigned and their access within the MCC New York restricted to the first floor.",
    "Tova Noel was specifically reassigned to work Staff Screening, Front Lobby, or Phone Monitor duties, and was instructed not to leave her assigned area without checking with a supervisor.",
    "The memoranda were issued by a Captain at the MCC, indicating a formal administrative action was taken against these staff members.",
    "The timing and nature of the documents suggest they are part of the immediate internal response and investigation following Epstein's death at the facility."
