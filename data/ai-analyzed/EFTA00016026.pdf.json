    "UK extradition law requires consent to be given irrevocably in writing to the UK court under Section 72(8) of the Extradition Act 2003, not to US authorities.",
    "A defendant's prophylactic 'consent to be extradited' given in the US would not be binding on a UK court or the defendant (referred to as 'RP' - requested person).",
    "The Crown Prosecution Service indicates that if a defendant returns to the UK and reneges on bail conditions, this would lead to an extradition request and affect bail decisions.",
    "The discussion involves a UK citizen detained in the US facing US charges who is seeking bail and wants to use consent to extradition as proof they are not a flight risk.",
    "Consent to extradition in the UK is irrevocable and not appealable, unlike a guilty plea which can be withdrawn."
