  "summary": "This document is an email chain from December 2020 among prosecutors in the Southern District of New York discussing a court order from Judge Engelmayer. The judge requested a declaration from the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to explain the disparities in discovery and counsel access between Ghislaine Maxwell (detained at MDC) and Justin Rivera (detained at MCC), which the defense argued were discriminatory. The emails detail the logistical and security justifications for the differing accommodations.",

    "The defense for Justin Rivera alleged the disparate treatment was based on race, gender, and class, framing it as a civil rights issue within the prison system."
