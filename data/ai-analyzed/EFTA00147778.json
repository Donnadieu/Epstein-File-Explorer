    "Following Epstein's death, the SDNY moved to dismiss the criminal case, but Judge Berman scheduled a hearing for August 27, 2019, to allow victims to be heard.",
    "20-30 victims were expected to attend the hearing, with many wanting to speak, and victim services were contacting uncounseled victims, many of whom were 'still in crisis.'",
    "Digital evidence seized included approximately 20 computers from the USVI and multiple devices from Epstein's Manhattan residence, with one iMac containing over 800,000 emails.",
    "The FBI hotline had received 168 total calls, including from a couple who worked for Epstein domestically from 2002-2003.",
    "Epstein's death complicated criminal forfeiture of his properties, as civil forfeiture could prevent victims from seeking compensation from his estate."
