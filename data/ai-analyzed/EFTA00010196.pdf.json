  "summary": "This is a joint letter from the prosecution and defense in the case of United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, filed on December 2, 2020, in response to a court order. The letter details the parties' disagreement over whether the warden of the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) should report directly to the court regarding Maxwell's conditions of confinement. The government advocates for a written report from MDC legal counsel, while the defense demands a personal appearance by Warden Heriberto Tellez to address what they describe as onerous, individualized, and excessive security measures targeting Maxwell.",
