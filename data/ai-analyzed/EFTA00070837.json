  "summary": "This is a government memorandum of law filed in the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal case (S2 20 Cr. 330) opposing the defense's proposed expert testimony of Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Elizabeth Loftus. The government argues that many of the experts' opinions are irrelevant, unreliable, within the common knowledge of the jury, invade the province of the jury, or are prejudicial. It seeks to preclude specific opinions while allowing a limited response from Dr. Dietz to the government's own expert, Dr. Lisa Rocchio.",
