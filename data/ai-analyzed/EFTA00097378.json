The defense argues the alleged perjurious statements from Maxwell's civil deposition were responses to fundamentally ambiguous questions, were literally true, and were immaterial to the defamation case in which they were made.",

    "The perjury charges against Ghislaine Maxwell (Counts Five and Six) stem from answers she gave during depositions in a civil defamation lawsuit filed against her by 'Jane Doe 3'.",
    "The defense argues the deposition questions were 'fundamentally ambiguous' (using terms like 'scheme' and 'recruit' without definition) and therefore cannot legally support a perjury conviction.",
    "The defense also argues Maxwell's answers were 'literally true' under the standard set by Bronston v. United States, placing the burden on the questioner to ask precise questions.",
    "The defamation lawsuit was based on a statement issued by Maxwell's UK lawyer, Ross Gow, which called Jane Doe 3's allegations 'untrue' and 'obvious lies'.",
    "Jane Doe 3's allegations, detailed in a 2014 motion to join a CVRA action, accused Maxwell of being a 'primary co-conspirator' with Epstein in a sex trafficking scheme and named other individuals including Alan Dershowitz and Jean Luc Brunel."
