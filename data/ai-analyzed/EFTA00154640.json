  "summary": "This is a 2021 opinion and order by Judge Alison J. Nathan in the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal case, resolving multiple pretrial motions. The court denies Maxwell's motions to dismiss based on Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement and statute of limitations, but grants her motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. The opinion details the legal reasoning regarding the scope and applicability of Epstein's NPA. This is a court opinion and order (Document 207) from the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell, filed on April 16, 2021. It addresses several defense motions to dismiss the indictment, including arguments related to the statute of limitations, pre-indictment delay, specificity of the charges, and the legal tenability of perjury counts. The court denies these motions, upholding the applicability of the extended statute of limitations for child sex abuse offenses and finding no due process violation. This is a court opinion and order from Judge Alison J. Nathan in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell. The court denies most of Maxwell's pretrial motions but grants her motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial. It also addresses motions to dismiss, strike surplusage, and compel discovery, setting deadlines for further proceedings.",

  "keyFacts": [
    "The court ruled Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement does not bar Maxwell's prosecution in New York, as it only binds the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida and does not cover the offenses charged (from 1994-1997).",
    "The court granted Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury charges from the Mann Act charges, ordering they be tried separately.",
    "The court denied Maxwell's motion to dismiss based on statute of limitations, applying the PROTECT Act's life-of-the-victim limit because the Mann Act charges 'involve' the sexual abuse of minors.",
    "The S1 superseding indictment charged Maxwell with two Mann Act counts, two related conspiracy counts, and two perjury counts based on her 2016 civil deposition.",
    "A second (S2) superseding indictment had been returned adding a sex trafficking count and another conspiracy count, but this opinion deals only with motions related to the S1 indictment.",
    "The court ruled that the extended statute of limitations under 18 U.S.C. § 3283 (as amended by the PROTECT Act) applies to Maxwell's alleged offenses, allowing prosecution even for conduct from the 1990s/early 2000s.",
    "The court rejected Maxwell's due process claim regarding pre-indictment delay, finding she failed to show the government intentionally delayed for an improper purpose or that she suffered serious prejudice to her defense.",
    "The court upheld the specificity of the indictment's Mann Act counts, finding the use of approximate timeframes and descriptions like 'grooming' sufficient, and that victim names are not required to be listed.",
    "The court denied the motion to dismiss the perjury counts, finding the questions from her civil deposition were not 'fundamentally ambiguous' and that materiality is a question for the jury.",
    "Maxwell argued that the deaths of potential witnesses, including Jeffrey Epstein and a Florida detective, prejudiced her defense, but the court found these claims speculative and insufficient to dismiss the indictment.",
    "The court granted Ghislaine Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts, ordering separate trials due to risks of unfair prejudice and potential disqualification of her chosen counsel.",
    "The court denied Maxwell's motion to dismiss the indictment based on Jeffrey Epstein's non-prosecution agreement, statute of limitations, pre-indictment delay, and other legal challenges.",
    "The court denied Maxwell's motions to strike surplusage from the indictment and to dismiss multiplicitous charges as premature, reserving these issues for trial.",
    "The court ordered the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all outstanding pretrial disclosures, including Brady/Giglio material, witness lists, and Rule 404(b) evidence.",
    "The court found that the return of an S2 superseding indictment by a Manhattan grand jury likely mooted Maxwell's challenge to the composition of the White Plains grand jury that returned the earlier S1 indictment."
