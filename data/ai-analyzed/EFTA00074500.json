    "The alleged criminal activity spanned from approximately 1994 to 2004, involving multiple minor victims identified as Minor Victim-1 (1994-1997) and Minor Victim-4 (2001-2004).",
    "The charges include both substantive crimes and conspiracy charges, with Maxwell also potentially liable under an aiding and abetting theory for the substantive counts.",
    "The document is a proposed joint jury instruction, indicating it was prepared for the judge's consideration to guide the jury in the legal standards applicable to the case.",
    "The instructions detail complex legal concepts such as conscious avoidance, the distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence, and the requirements for proving conspiracy."
