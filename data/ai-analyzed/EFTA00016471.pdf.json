Nathan regarding the defense's motion to exclude the government's expert witness, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, in the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal case.

    "The court ruled that Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert on trauma and sexual abuse, is qualified and her proposed testimony on grooming and victim behavior is largely admissible under the Daubert standard.",
    "The court excluded one specific opinion from Dr. Rocchio: that the presence of a third party can facilitate grooming ('grooming-by-proxy'), finding it lacked sufficient support in the relevant literature.",
    "The defense's motion to exclude Dr. Rocchio's testimony was based on arguments about reliability, relevance, and prejudicial effect, which the court largely rejected.",
    "The opinion cites numerous prior cases from various circuits where similar expert testimony on grooming and trauma bonding has been admitted.",
    "The government alleges Ghislaine Maxwell both participated in sexual abuse of minors and conspired with Jeffrey Epstein, who groomed and abused minors."
