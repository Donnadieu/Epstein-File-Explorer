  "keyFacts": [
    "The retired warden states that prior to placing Epstein in the SHU, they vetted several inmates and identified only one as an appropriate cellmate.",
    "The warden claims that due to the constant movement of inmates out of the SHU (via transfers, releases, or moves to other units) and the number of inmates posing a threat to Epstein's safety, there were no potential backup inmates available to house with him.",
    "The document clarifies that pre-trial inmates (like Epstein) and designated inmates cannot be housed together, which limited the pool of potential cellmates.",
    "The warden's core argument is that the decision not to select a backup cellmate was based on institutional mission, inmate movement, and safety assessments, not poor judgment."
