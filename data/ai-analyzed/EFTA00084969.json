    "The interviewed BOP Senior Officer Specialist stated he was never informed that Jeffrey Epstein required a new cellmate after Efrain Reyes was released on August 9, 2019, contradicting other potential accounts.",
    "The officer described staffing levels at MCC New York as 'abysmal' and stated standard 30-minute inmate checks were often not performed as required, especially on shower days.",
    "On August 9, 2019, the officer's shift began at ~8:45 AM; Epstein was already in an attorney conference room and never returned to the SHU during that shift, and Reyes was already gone.",
    "The officer asserted that if he had been told Epstein needed a cellmate, he would have ensured it happened, but no one—including Captain, Lieutenant, Psychology Department, or SOS Roberto—told him.",
    "The document reveals operational challenges and potential failures in protocol at MCC New York's SHU in the period leading up to Epstein's death."
