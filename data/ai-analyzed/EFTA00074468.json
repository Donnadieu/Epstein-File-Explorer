  "summary": "This is a motion in limine filed by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team seeking to exclude 'Government Exhibit 52' from her criminal trial. The motion argues the 97-page document is unauthenticated hearsay with questionable provenance, allegedly surfacing in 2009 through former Epstein employee Alfredo Rodriguez who tried to sell it to a lawyer. The defense claims the document cannot be authenticated, is not a business record, and is prejudicial.",
