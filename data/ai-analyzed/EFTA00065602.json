    "The legal opinion concludes it is 'extremely unlikely' Ghislaine Maxwell would be granted bail in the UK if she fled US proceedings, and 'highly unlikely' she could successfully resist extradition.",
    "Maxwell signed a waiver of her right to contest extradition to the US, which would be admissible in UK proceedings and could expedite the process to 1-3 months.",
    "The opinion analyzes potential bars to extradition (forum, passage of time, human rights) and finds they would almost certainly fail in Maxwell's case given the seriousness of the charges.",
    "The document is part of Maxwell's legal team's preparations, indicating consideration of a scenario where she might flee to the UK while on bail in the US.",
    "The superseding indictment against Maxwell alleges offenses occurring between 1994 and 1997, including conspiracy to commit indecent assault and perjury."
