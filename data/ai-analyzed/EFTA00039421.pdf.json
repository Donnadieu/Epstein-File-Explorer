  "summary": "This is the U.S. Government's omnibus opposition memorandum to Ghislaine Maxwell's twelve pre-trial motions in her criminal case (S1 20 Cr. 330). It argues against motions to dismiss based on Epstein's non-prosecution agreement, statute of limitations, pre-indictment delay, and multiplicity; motions to suppress evidence obtained via subpoena; motions to sever counts; motions for bills of particulars and other disclosures; and a motion challenging the grand jury selection. The document provides detailed factual and legal arguments supporting the prosecution's position.",

    "The Government asserts the grand jury sitting in White Plains that indicted Maxwell was properly constituted, and her fair cross-section challenge fails because the relevant community is the counties from which that jury pool was drawn, not Manhattan."
