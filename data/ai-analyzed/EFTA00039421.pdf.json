  "summary": "This is the U.S. Government's omnibus opposition memorandum to Ghislaine Maxwell's twelve pre-trial motions in her criminal case (S1 20 Cr. 330). It argues against motions to dismiss based on Epstein's non-prosecution agreement, statute of limitations, pre-indictment delay, suppression of evidence, perjury charges, severance, sufficiency of the indictment, striking surplusage, multiplicity, and various disclosure requests. It also defends the use of a White Plains grand jury.",
