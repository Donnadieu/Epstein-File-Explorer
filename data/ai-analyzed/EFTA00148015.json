    "The FBI and SDNY were processing terabytes of digital evidence seized from Epstein's properties in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including computers, servers, phones, tablets, and loose media.",
    "Prosecutors expressed frustration over difficulties in reviewing the data due to formatting issues, inability to link emails to attachments, and lack of a clear inventory linking data to specific seized devices.",
    "The case was described as 'top-driven on both sides (FBI and SDNY) due to the incredible amount of media attention it has received,' indicating high-level pressure.",
    "A 2007 search of one of Epstein's properties was referenced, with 9 IDE hard drives from that search found in his Manhattan apartment during the 2019 searches.",
    "The correspondence reveals internal coordination challenges between the FBI's Computer Analysis Response Team (CART) and prosecutors regarding evidence processing and transfer timelines."
