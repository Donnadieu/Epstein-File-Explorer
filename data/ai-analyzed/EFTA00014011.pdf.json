  "summary": "This is a letter from Gail E. Ferguson, Assistant Ethics Counsel for The Florida Bar, to an unnamed Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of Florida. The letter responds to the AUSA's request for an advisory ethics opinion concerning their past conduct in contacting victims to inform them of case resolutions and a court order. Ferguson denies the request, citing Bar procedures that limit opinions to future conduct, but discusses relevant Florida Bar rules on solicitation, communication with represented persons, and compliance with court orders.",

    "An Assistant U.S. Attorney sought an ethics opinion regarding their contact with victims to inform them of case resolutions and a court order offering free legal representation.",
    "The Florida Bar's ethics counsel denied the opinion, stating they can only advise on future conduct, not past actions or legal interpretations of statutes and court orders.",
    "The letter references a court order requiring the AUSA to advise victims that free independent attorney services would be offered to them.",
    "The discussion centers on whether the AUSA's victim contact constituted improper solicitation (Rule 4-7.4) or violated rules about communicating with represented persons (Rule 4-4.2).",
    "The underlying context involves a resolved legal matter with victims, likely connected to the Epstein case given the document's provenance."
