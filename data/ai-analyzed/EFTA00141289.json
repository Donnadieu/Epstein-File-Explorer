    "The OIG's original June 2023 report made eight recommendations to the BOP regarding its handling of Jeffrey Epstein and broader prison procedures.",
    "As of this December 2025 update, Recommendation 7 is closed, and the other seven recommendations remain 'Resolved' but not fully closed, pending final BOP policy revisions.",
    "The BOP is in the process of revising multiple Program Statements (e.g., 5321.09, 5324.08, 5500.14, 4200.12) to address the recommendations, but the OIG notes the process has taken over two years and urges expedited action.",
    "The recommendations focus on critical prison operations: assigning cellmates after suicide watch, maintaining cellmates for high-risk inmates, visit approval processes, inmate accountability, lieutenant round procedures, staffing shortages, and security camera system protocols.",
    "Regarding staffing (Recommendation 6), the BOP reported that retention incentives improved retention rates but were significantly reduced or eliminated in March 2025 due to budgetary constraints."
