    "The court ruled that attorney David Markus, who has represented Ghislaine Maxwell on bail appeals and spoken publicly as her counsel, is subject to Local Criminal Rule 23.1, which restricts extrajudicial statements by lawyers associated with pending criminal litigation.",
    "The order clarifies that the rule applies to lawyers 'associated' with a case, not just those who have formally filed a notice of appearance, due to the risk their public comments could influence potential jurors.",
    "The court did not discipline Markus for a prior op-ed but issued a clear warning that he and all lawyers associated with the case must comply with the rule going forward to protect the integrity of the trial.",
    "The document references Maxwell's appeals of bail-denial determinations to the Second Circuit, indicating ongoing pre-trial legal battles.",
    "The order underscores the court's concern about protecting Maxwell's right to a fair trial by an impartial jury from being prejudiced by public statements."
