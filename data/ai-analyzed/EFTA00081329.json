  "keyFacts": [
    "Former U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta states that Epstein's defense team was the most aggressive he or his prosecutors had ever encountered, employing tactics like investigating prosecutors' families and repeatedly appealing to Washington.",
    "The prosecution's consistent position was that Epstein must plead to state felony charges resulting in 2 years imprisonment, sex offender registration, and victim restitution, or face a federal trial.",
    "Acosta acknowledges that evidence which came to light after 2007 (victim statements, physical evidence) might have changed the outcome, but the prosecution decision was based on admissible facts known at the time.",
    "Epstein's defense team included high-profile attorneys Roy Black, Alan Dershowitz, Kenneth Starr, and Jay Lefkowitz, and also included former federal prosecutors.",
    "Acosta defends the final plea deal, arguing it was better to secure a guaranteed sentence for a billionaire than risk a trial with a reduced likelihood of success based on the evidence then available."
