    "Pornographic images of young girls were found in the evidence and were not scanned per protocol; notations were made in the files stating 'possible child pornography DO NOT SCAN.'",
    "Digital discs containing PDFs, JPGs, GIFs, and TIF files were found scattered throughout the evidence boxes; they were copied but not processed, with four copies made of each disc as standard procedure.",
    "Some 1A documents (1A10, 1A28, 1A84) and serials in 31E-MM-108062 were missing from their file jackets, possibly between 2013 and 2015, and had to be regenerated from digital copies.",
    "The evidence scanning was under time pressure with an original deadline of July 10, 2019, but was extended due to the volume of boxes and the July 4th holiday."
