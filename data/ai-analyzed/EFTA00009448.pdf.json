    "The investigation used controlled phone calls, recorded by law enforcement, in late March 2006 to gather evidence. These calls discussed girls returning to 'work' for Epstein.",
    "A key victim was recruited at age 17, with phone records showing contact beginning at that age. She was approached at the beach by two individuals about giving Epstein a massage for money.",
    "Epstein asked a girl her age, grade, and school when she came to his house. She stated she was 18 and in the 12th grade.",
    "The witness testified that, based on a victim's appearance and mannerisms at age 16, it was circumstantial evidence that Epstein should have known she was underage, though there was no 'concrete' evidence he knew a specific victim's age."
