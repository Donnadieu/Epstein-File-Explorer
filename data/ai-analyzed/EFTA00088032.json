    "Correctional officers Michael Thomas and Tova Noel are criminally charged for falsifying inmate count slips on the night Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in his MCC cell.",
    "The court denied Thomas's motion to compel production of the DOJ Inspector General's report on Epstein's death, as the report was not yet completed and the government stated it had already provided all relevant investigatory materials.",
    "The court also denied Thomas's motion to compel materials from the Bureau of Prisons, finding the BOP was not part of the 'prosecution team' for this criminal case.",
    "The government had already produced extensive discovery, including surveillance video, count slips, staffing records, phone records, employee files, and witness statements.",
    "Thomas's motion argued for discovery to support a defense that falsifying count slips was widespread and tolerated by BOP leadership, but the court found he failed to make the required particularized showing."
