    "Leon Black paid Jeffrey Epstein $158 million between 2012 and 2017 for tax and estate planning advice, averaging about $25 million per year.",
    "Epstein allegedly devised a 'proprietary' solution involving a mutual release of claims to resolve an estate tax issue with a 2006 trust, potentially avoiding over $1 billion in gift and estate taxes on assets worth over $2 billion.",
    "Epstein also claimed credit for a 'step-up-basis transaction' that Black's attorneys say originated with others, but for which Epstein was paid $20 million after demanding $60 million.",
    "The Senate Finance Committee states Black has refused to answer key questions about the amounts over-distributed to him from a trust, the consideration in the mutual release, his retained voting powers, loans against trust assets, and the substantiation for Epstein's extraordinary compensation.",
    "The Dechert report, commissioned by Apollo's board, found Black's payments to Epstein 'far exceeded any amounts Black paid to his other professional advisors' and that Black was under the misconception the payments were tax-deductible based on Epstein's advice."
