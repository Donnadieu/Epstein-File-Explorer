  "summary": "This document is an email chain from September 2020 between the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and attorneys from Blackfords LLP in London. The prosecutors are seeking a voluntary interview with the law firm's client regarding the investigation into Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. The client's attorneys offer a written witness statement limited to the 1994-1997 indictment period but refuse a live interview, citing concerns that their client is considered a 'subject' rather than a witness.",
