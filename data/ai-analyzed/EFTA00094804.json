  "summary": "This is a letter from Ghislaine Maxwell's defense counsel to Judge Loretta A. Preska requesting reconsideration of an order to unseal Maxwell's deposition transcripts and to commence contempt proceedings for violation of a protective order. The letter argues the government improperly obtained the confidential deposition transcripts, used them to indict Maxwell for perjury, and that unsealing would prejudice her right to a fair trial. This is a court filing from Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team requesting reconsideration of a decision to unseal deposition transcripts. It argues that Maxwell reasonably relied on a protective order when giving deposition testimony, and that providing the transcripts to the government for perjury charges violated legal precedent (Martindell). The document suggests a 'perjury trap' was set for Maxwell.",

    "The letter cites Maxwell's arrest on July 2, 2020, and a superseding indictment on July 8, 2020, as new facts justifying reconsideration of the unsealing order to protect her right to a fair trial.",
    "The protective order specifically excluded a 'law enforcement' exception, a point negotiated by the parties, which Maxwell's counsel claims the government violated.",
    "The defense requests the court commence contempt proceedings against those who violated the protective order and to stay any unsealing to allow for an appeal to the Second Circuit.",
    "The filing argues the government circumvented legal precedent (Martindell v. International Telephone & Telegraph Corp.) by obtaining sealed deposition transcripts to charge Ghislaine Maxwell with perjury, suggesting a 'perjury trap' was set.",
    "Ghislaine Maxwell's defense claims she reasonably relied on a protective order when giving intimate personal details in her deposition, and that the Second Circuit's ruling in Brown v. Maxwell supports keeping such information confidential.",
    "The plaintiff allegedly attached the full deposition transcripts to court submissions and leaked them or caused them to be leaked to the government, leading to the perjury charges against Maxwell.",
    "A prior motion by Maxwell to obtain information about any criminal investigation was denied by Judge Sweet, and the plaintiff later produced no such materials before her deposition."
