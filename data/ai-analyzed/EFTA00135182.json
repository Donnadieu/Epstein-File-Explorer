The content is largely unreadable, consisting of garbled characters, file references (like SDNY_00007651, EFTA00135182), and occasional legible words or fragments (e.g., 'EMPLOYEE', 'bail'). No coherent narrative, names, events, or factual claims about the Epstein case can be reliably extracted.",

    "No named individuals, dates, locations, or specific events can be identified from the garbled text."
