Tartaglione. The letter will inform the court that due to errors in the Metropolitan Correctional Center's (MCC) computer system, video footage from outside the cell shared by Nicholas Tartaglione and Jeffrey Epstein on the night of Epstein's suicide attempt was not preserved, correcting earlier statements to the contrary. The document anticipates significant press attention.",
