Nathan, seeking to quash a subpoena issued by Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team to the administrator of the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (EVCP).

    "The U.S. Attorney's Office is moving to quash Ghislaine Maxwell's subpoena for records from the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program, arguing it fails the legal standard from United States v. Nixon.",
    "The subpoena sought four categories: payment records to victims, release forms, all material submitted by victims to the EVCP, and communications between the EVCP and victims/counsel.",
    "The government argues the information is either already in the defense's possession, not relevant/admissible, or the request is a 'fishing expedition' that would confuse the jury under Rule 403.",
    "The government notes that at least two victims expected to file submissions regarding the subpoena.",
    "The document references 'Minor Victims' and 'Witness-3' as claimants/witnesses, acknowledging a court order that Witness-3 should not be referenced at trial as a victim."
