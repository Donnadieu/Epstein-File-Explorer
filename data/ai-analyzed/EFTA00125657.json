    "The SIS lieutenant conducted the investigation into Epstein's July 2019 alleged suicide attempt and found it inconclusive, though Epstein was placed on suicide watch.",
    "Epstein was required to have a cellmate after coming off suicide watch/psych observation, but his cellmate Reyes was transferred on August 9, 2019, and no replacement was assigned due to multiple notification failures.",
    "The MCC camera recording system had been offline since July 29, 2019, and was not discovered until August 8, 2019. Key personnel (a captain and associate warden) were verbally notified but the system was not fixed.",
    "The lieutenant believes systematic failures—specifically the lack of a cellmate and failures in conducting rounds and counts—were key factors that allowed Epstein to take his own life.",
    "Evidence collected on August 10 included a noose, a CPAP machine, pill bottles, and an excessive amount of linen in Epstein's cell, which was noted as a security issue."
