    "A RAID array failure occurred in a NICE Vision Pro Unit NVR at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York on or before August 8, 2019.",
    "The failure involved two bad drives, and an attempt to replace them without proper shutdown corrupted the video database, potentially causing data loss.",
    "The service request indicates the system was at 'FBOP MCC New York', linking it to the Federal Bureau of Prisons facility where Jeffrey Epstein was held.",
    "Technical support communications reference prior requests for RAID rebuild documentation dating back to February 2019.",
    "The document is a routine IT service record but gains significance due to its location (MCC New York) and timing (August 2019) relative to Epstein's incarceration."
