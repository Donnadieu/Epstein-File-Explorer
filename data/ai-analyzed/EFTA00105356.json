    "The defense reports significant discovery problems: thousands of photos are unreadable, corrupt files, missing metadata, and discrepancies in the count of 'highly confidential' images (initially said to be ~2,100, but an FBI report indicates ~34,000).",
    "The prosecution defines 'Highly Confidential' material broadly as containing 'nude, partially-nude, or otherwise sexualized images, videos, or other depictions of individuals' and insists defense can only view it under law enforcement supervision, not possess copies.",
    "The defense argues the 'Highly Confidential' designation is overly broad, noting some images only show 'a woman's back or shoulder,' and requests access to all such material except potential child pornography.",
    "The correspondence references a '3D scan of Epstein's private island' among the produced materials, indicating the scope of evidence seized.",
    "The email chain reveals ongoing, unresolved technical and procedural disputes about evidence access that the defense suggests may require court intervention."
