  "summary": "This is a letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York to Judge Alison J. Nathan, outlining the government's plan to obtain and review investigative files from the prior Florida investigation into Jeffrey Epstein for potential disclosure in the Ghislaine Maxwell case. It details the sources of files, the legal framework for disclosure obligations, and the steps being taken to review materials from various Florida agencies. This is a government filing from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York to Judge Alison J. Nathan, dated October 7, 2020. It outlines the prosecution's planned approach to reviewing materials from prior investigations (specifically the USAO-SDFL's Florida investigation and the USAO-SDGA's involvement in CVRA civil litigation) for potential Giglio and Jencks Act (3500) material relevant to the Ghislaine Maxwell prosecution, while arguing those prior offices are not part of the current prosecution team.",

    "The government states that the Florida Prosecution Team had no involvement in the current Maxwell investigation and thus, under legal precedent, their files are not automatically considered in the government's 'possession' for disclosure obligations.",
    "The government argues that the prior investigating offices (USAO-SDFL and USAO-SDGA) are not part of the current Ghislaine Maxwell prosecution team, as they did not participate in witness interviews, strategy, charging decisions, or the grand jury presentation.",
