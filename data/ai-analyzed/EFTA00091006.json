  "summary": "This is a letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York to Judge Alison J. Nathan regarding the proposed protective order in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell. The government opposes two specific modifications requested by the defense: (1) allowing the defense to publicly name victims who have spoken publicly about Epstein or Maxwell, and (2) imposing restrictions on the government's use of its own investigative materials. The government argues these requests lack legal basis and would harm victim privacy.",

    "The government strongly opposes the defense's request to publicly name victims who have ever spoken about Epstein or Maxwell in any public forum, calling it 'extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate.'",
    "The government argues victim privacy is protected by the Crime Victims' Rights Act and that public identification could deter other victims from reporting crimes.",
    "The government's proposed order would allow the defense to name only victims who affirmatively identify themselves on the record in *this* specific criminal case, not those who spoke publicly in the past.",
    "The government also opposes the defense's unprecedented request to restrict how the government uses its own investigative documents with witnesses, stating such restrictions lack legal basis.",
    "The document reveals an ongoing, contentious pretrial dispute over the scope of victim anonymity and the handling of discovery materials."
