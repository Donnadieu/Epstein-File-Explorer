  "summary": "This document is a series of email exchanges from April 2021 between an individual identifying as a New York State Public Notary and the legal visit scheduling department (BRO-LegalVisit-S) at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) Brooklyn. The notary is attempting to schedule a 'legal visit' with inmate Ghislaine Maxwell but is denied because the facility is only allowing attorney visits. The notary argues that notaries have the power to execute legal contracts and demands Maxwell's right to additional legal counsel.",
