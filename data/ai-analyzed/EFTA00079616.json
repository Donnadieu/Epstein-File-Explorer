    "The U.S. Attorney's Office was preparing a massive volume of discovery (multiple numbered productions) for Ghislaine Maxwell's defense team in late November 2020.",
    "The process involved copying materials from a shared drive, a hard drive copy made for Maxwell at MDC, and expected materials from an external contractor (PAE).",
    "The email notes that all 'highly confidential items' had been removed from the materials being produced to the defense.",
    "The copying job was anticipated to be a multi-day process due to the volume of data, specifically referencing that loading the 'Sixth Production' alone took many hours.",
    "The correspondence reveals logistical coordination between a paralegal, an in-office colleague (M), and potentially other staff to fulfill discovery obligations."
