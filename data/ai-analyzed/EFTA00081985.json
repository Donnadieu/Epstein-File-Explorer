    "Prosecutors determined they 'almost certainly couldn't bring an enticement charge' against Epstein based on timing and location facts.",
    "A victim was still unsure whether she wanted to pursue a criminal case; her attorneys were to be circled back with later in November 2019.",
    "The victim did not want to discuss specific conduct at the California meeting, so no additional information was obtained.",
    "Prosecutors were continuing to work on a 'pile of memos' and noted a witness was coming in for a limited proffer session.",
    "The email chain shows ongoing coordination among federal prosecutors in the Epstein investigation in late 2019."
