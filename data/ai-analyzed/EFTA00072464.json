    "Ghislaine Maxwell was granted extensive and privileged access to review discovery, receiving 13 hours per day, 7 days a week on both a government-provided laptop and an MDC desktop computer, which was stated to be more than any other inmate at the MDC.",
    "Maxwell's conditions included rigorous search protocols: daily pat-downs (including mouth checks), weekly body scans, daily cell searches, and 15-minute nighttime wellness checks where staff used a flashlight to confirm she was breathing.",
    "The government defended the MDC's handling of Maxwell's complaints, including an investigation that found a pat-down search she complained about was appropriately conducted and recorded, and that issues with her cell cleanliness were due to her own hygiene habits.",
    "Maxwell's weight was monitored, fluctuating between the 130s and 140s, with her lowest recorded weight being 133 pounds in July 2021, which corresponded to a normal BMI for her height (5'7\").",
    "Attorney communication shifted from in-person visits to daily video-teleconference (VTC) calls during COVID-19 suspensions, with Maxwell eventually receiving up to 5 hours of VTC calls with counsel on weekdays."
