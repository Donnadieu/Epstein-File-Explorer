  "summary": "This document is an email chain from September 2020 between the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and attorneys from Blackfords LLP representing Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. It details the breakdown of negotiations for a voluntary interview, with the U.S. prosecutors seeking a live interview and the Duke's legal team offering only a written witness statement and written Q&A, limited to topics relevant to the Ghislaine Maxwell indictment. The U.S. side ultimately states they will proceed with a compelled interview request via the UK Central Authority.",
