    "The MDC Brooklyn claims Ghislaine Maxwell has access to a government-provided laptop for discovery review for 13 hours per day, 5 days a week.",
    "Maxwell also has access to MDC discovery computers, which the institution states can review most of her electronic discovery.",
    "Maxwell is allowed to communicate with her legal counsel 5 days a week, 3 hours per day via video-teleconference and phone, which the MDC states is far more than any other inmate.",
    "The MDC requests Judge Nathan vacate her January 15, 2021 order and allow a return to the prior laptop access schedule (Monday-Friday, 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM).",
    "The letter indicates the MDC had previously objected to the defense counsel's claims through the U.S. Attorney's Office but was not given a chance to object directly to the court before the order was issued."
