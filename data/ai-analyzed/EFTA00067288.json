    "The DOJ's Child Exploitation Obscenity Section (CEOS) was reviewing the Jeffrey Epstein matter in February 2008, with a meeting planned for the week of March 31, 2008.",
    "A deferred prosecution agreement existed, originally requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges by October 26, 2007, but the deadline had been postponed multiple times.",
    "The U.S. Attorney's Office agreed to extend the compliance deadline to allow CEOS time for a thorough review, contingent on Epstein's counsel meeting with CEOS.",
    "The outcome of the CEOS review was critical: if CEOS decided against federal prosecution, the investigation would close; if CEOS disagreed with Epstein's position, Epstein would have one week to comply with the 2007 agreement."
