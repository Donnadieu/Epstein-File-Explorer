    "The BOP lieutenant confirms that 'pre-remove' and 'WAB' are essentially the same, indicating an inmate is leaving the building and not expected to return, unlike a court appearance which would be logged differently.",
    "The witness had been interviewed twice before regarding the Epstein matter, on August 19, 2019, and July 14, 2021.",
    "The interview investigates a critical procedural lapse: why Jeffrey Epstein was not assigned a new cellmate after his cellmate, Efren Reyes, was transferred on August 9, 2019.",
    "Officer 1, the OIC, states he told other officers (Monge and others) that Epstein needed a new cellmate, but those officers deny being told, creating a discrepancy.",
    "Documentary evidence (emails, logs) shows Reyes was scheduled for transfer and was listed as 'WAB' (With All Belongings), which typically indicates a permanent departure, yet Officer 1 claims uncertainty about whether Reyes would return.",
    "A separate incident involving inmate Fernandez on the same day is discussed, highlighting general operational chaos and unclear chains of responsibility for inmate movements and notifications within the MCC.",
    "The interview reveals potential systemic issues in communication and accountability among MCC staff regarding inmate status changes and cell assignments."
