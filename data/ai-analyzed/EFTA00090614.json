The sender claims to have evidence of Vance covering up two major crimes: a million-dollar embezzlement and child abuse by a priest (Fr. Miqueli) as a favor to Cardinal Dolan, and a Rikers Island bribe scheme involving inmate Gigi Jordan, her lawyer Alan Dershowitz, and corrections union head Norman Seabrook. The sender describes being arrested and maliciously prosecuted after threatening to expose this information.",
