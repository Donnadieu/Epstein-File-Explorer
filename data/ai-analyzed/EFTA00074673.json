    "In April 2019, the Southern District of New York (SDNY) had an open criminal matter involving Jeff Epstein and was actively seeking evidence from the prior Florida investigation.",
    "The Miami FBI was reluctant to send materials to the SDNY FBI without a specific authorization letter (a '6e letter').",
    "The original U.S. Attorney's Office that handled the Florida case was recused from the underlying criminal matter and therefore could not authorize the evidence transfer.",
    "The email chain aims to connect SDNY with the new prosecutors handling the old Florida case to obtain the necessary authorization for the grand jury materials."
