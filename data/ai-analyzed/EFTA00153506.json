  "keyFacts": [
    "Prosecutors were actively subpoenaing travel records from multiple airlines (United, American, Delta, Alaska, Southwest, JetBlue) and Expedia as part of the investigation into Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "Expedia required additional identifiers like email addresses, credit card numbers, or itinerary numbers because their databases lacked date of birth information to identify customers.",
    "JetBlue was not served because prosecutors had not confirmed confidentiality with them, and it was noted that JetBlue did not begin flying until 2000.",
    "The subpoenas were served via legal process handlers, with Expedia requiring service through National Registered Agents, Inc. at a CT Corp office in New York.",
    "Prosecutors were under timing pressure to obtain the airline records before traveling to California for the investigation."
