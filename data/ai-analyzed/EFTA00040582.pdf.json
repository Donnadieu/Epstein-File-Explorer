    "Prosecutors were negotiating a proffer agreement with a client/witness on November 25, 2019, viewing it as a step toward resolving the matter.",
    "The discussion centered on ensuring the proffer was protected under Federal Rule of Evidence 410, which governs the inadmissibility of withdrawn pleas and offers.",
    "The witness's proposed waiver of protections was to be limited solely to criminal proceedings brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office.",
    "The intended topics for the proffer included the individual's background, upbringing, employment, and crucially, 'how she went about scheduling, as well as the abuse'.",
    "Prosecutors noted they do not ordinarily treat investigative interviews or innocence proffers as covered by Rule 410, but were checking with supervisors about making an exception in this case."
