    "Under the new definitions, 12% of the U.S. population lives in urban areas, 69% in suburban areas, and 19% in rural areas, a significant shift from the old definitions (33% urban, 53% suburban, 14% rural).",
    "In 2019, based on the new classifications, the rate of violent victimization declined in urban areas from 2018, but showed no significant change in suburban or rural areas; property crime rates declined in suburban and rural areas.",

    "Extensive statistical tables present estimates and standard errors for violent and property crime victimization rates from 1993 through 2019.",
    "The document notes a revised 2016 NCVS data file was created due to a sample size increase and adjustment to reflect the 2010 census, which affected year-to-year comparisons.",
