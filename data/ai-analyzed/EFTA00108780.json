    "The document reveals an active FBI obstruction of justice investigation into Rodriguez in October 2009, separate from the main Epstein case, focused on his attempt to profit from evidence.",
    "The processing request highlights the scale and technological approach of the investigation, involving scanning, OCR, and data formatting for a centralized intelligence repository."
