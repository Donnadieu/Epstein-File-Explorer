  "summary": "This is a legal brief filed by Virginia Giuffre's attorneys in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals opposing Ghislaine Maxwell's motion to consolidate her civil appeal (regarding document unsealing) with her criminal appeal. The document argues consolidation would delay public access to judicial documents and serves Maxwell's interests in hindering the unsealing process rather than judicial efficiency.",

  "keyFacts": [
    "Virginia Giuffre opposes Ghislaine Maxwell's motion to consolidate her civil appeal (document unsealing) with her criminal appeal, arguing they involve completely separate legal issues.",
    "The document alleges Maxwell has engaged in repeated delay tactics to hinder the document unsealing process ordered by the Second Circuit over 14 months earlier.",
    "Giuffre's legal team argues consolidation would sacrifice justice by allowing Maxwell to 'hold hostage' the unsealing process by tying it to unrelated criminal proceedings.",
    "The filing emphasizes the public's strong right of access to judicial documents and argues any delay from consolidation would violate this fundamental principle.",
    "The civil appeal concerns whether Judge Preska abused her discretion in ordering documents unsealed, while the criminal appeal concerns evidence admissibility issues before Judge Nathan."
