    "During the midnight count on August 10, 2019, there was a discrepancy because an inmate from SHU was being housed in R&D. COs Thomas and Noel initially reported a count of 73 but noted the inmate in R&D. The lieutenant instructed a recount to reflect 72, but a corrected count slip may not have been collected.",
    "The lieutenant states that the MCC was severely understaffed at the time, with correctional officers routinely working 16+ hour days due to mandatory overtime, which impacted the ability to perform all duties and communicate effectively.",
    "The lieutenant had no knowledge that cameras in the SHU were not working on the night of Epstein's death and was not aware of any policy violations by COs Thomas and Noel regarding counts or rounds, expressing surprise at the suggestion they might have falsified them."
