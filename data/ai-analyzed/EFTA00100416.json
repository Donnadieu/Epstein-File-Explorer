    "Jeffrey Epstein, a level 3 registered sex offender, was reportedly sighted several times in late 2018 and early 2019 riding a bicycle on the Palm Beach bike path accompanied by a very young Caucasian brunette girl with a ponytail, estimated to be not older than 18.",
    "The email author had previously reported a December 2018 sighting to Mr. [Redacted], the former Palm Beach Chief of Police who led the original 2005 Epstein investigation.",
    "Mr. [Redacted] indicated there are cameras on the PB bike path, registered offenders are not allowed on the path, and a sighting could make Epstein's incident a police matter, but video tapes are reviewed every 3 months and then erased.",
    "The Palm Beach police department, when contacted the prior week, had no knowledge of the reported incident involving Epstein and the young girl.",
    "The correspondence raises legal questions about why a registered offender would be allowed in areas where children congregate and whether a sighting in such an area warrants police investigation or arrest."
