  "keyFacts": [
    "The investigation uncovered a sex abuse and trafficking scheme affecting 'more than one hundred' and 'hundreds' of minor victims, far beyond what was previously known.",
    "The scheme operated like a 'pyramid scheme of sexual abuse,' where minor girls were paid to give sexualized massages to Epstein and were then paid to recruit other girls.",
    "The investigative team executed over a dozen search warrants, seized dozens of electronic devices containing terabytes of data, and conducted more than 400 interviews of over 150 witnesses across multiple states and two foreign countries.",
    "The prosecution team used 'novel applications of the sex trafficking and enticement statutes' to build their case against Maxwell and Epstein.",
    "The document notes the investigation began after a media report described controversy over a prior state plea agreement for Epstein, implying the federal case was a corrective action."
