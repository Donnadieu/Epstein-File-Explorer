    "The Virgin Islands Attorney General and Epstein's estate reached an agreement in principle on a revised victim compensation fund in June 2020, which included reforms like victim advocate involvement and dedicated funding for opt-out victims.",
    "A key provision of the agreement is that the fund administrator will inform claimants that counseling is available through the FBI Victim Services Division or similar entities.",
    "The FBI clarified that victims must be identified by the case agent to be eligible for counseling assistance, with a limit of 12 sessions for those in states without crime victim compensation.",
    "The Estate of Jeffrey Epstein created a voluntary Claims Fund Program with no cap on available funds, administered independently by a Program Administrator who evaluates claims separately.",
    "The Virgin Islands AG had previously filed a civil action and placed liens on Epstein's estate, arguing the original fund terms were illegal and protected co-conspirators."
