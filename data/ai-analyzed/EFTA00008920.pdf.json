    "An FBI agent testified that three victims (Victim-1, Victim-2, Victim-3) alleged they were sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein as minors, with Ghislaine Maxwell playing a key role in grooming, facilitating, and sometimes participating in the abuse.",
    "The agent described a pattern of grooming where Epstein and Maxwell would meet girls, gain their and their parents' trust through financial assistance and mentorship, and then escalate to sexual abuse, often in the context of 'massages'.",
    "Flight logs for Epstein's private jet from the 1990s were entered as evidence, showing flights with passengers including Epstein, Maxwell (initials G.M.), and Victim-1 (listed by name) to locations like Traverse City, Michigan (near Interlochen), Teterboro, NJ, and Santa Fe, NM.",
    "The agent testified that Maxwell gave sworn deposition testimony in 2016 where she denied knowledge of underage massages, denied possessing or knowing about sex toys at Epstein's properties, and denied giving anyone a massage—statements contradicted by witness accounts and evidence.",
    "Evidence from law enforcement searches in 2005 (Palm Beach) and 2019 (NYC) of Epstein's properties found massage tables, sex toys (including vibrators, dildos, handcuffs), nude photographs of young females, and a school-girl outfit, corroborating victim accounts."
