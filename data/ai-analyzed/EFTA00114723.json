    "The witness states the internal court list/roster generated for the SHU is printed daily and discarded, not retained, making it impossible to verify what was listed next to Reyes's name (e.g., WAB) after the fact.",
    "The witness heard rumors about staff not conducting rounds/counts and falsifying logs on August 9-10, 2019, but has no firsthand knowledge. She attributes potential problems to a lack of training and staffing.",
    "The witness was asked to conduct wellness check calls to Officers Noel and another officer in August 2019 but never made contact with them."
