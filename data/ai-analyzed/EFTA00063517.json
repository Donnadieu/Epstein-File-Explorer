It includes the autopsy report, toxicology reports, neuropathology report, and anthropology report, all concluding the cause of death was suicide by hanging. The documents detail the forensic findings and certify the records as official business records. This document is the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner's case file for Jeffrey Epstein, detailing the investigation into his death on August 10, 2019, at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. It includes the death certificate worksheet, autopsy request forms, scene investigation report, and case notes documenting communication with family and law enforcement. This document contains internal case notes from the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner regarding the death investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. It details the receipt of evidence, autopsy procedures, coordination with law enforcement, and family involvement, including the presence of a privately retained pathologist to observe the autopsy. This document contains the official Notice of Death for Jeffrey Epstein, a Clinical Summary Worksheet, a Mortuary Release Document, and excerpts from the Metropolitan Correctional Center's Daily Lieutenant's Logs covering the days before and after his death. It records the circumstances of his death at the MCC, his transport to the hospital, and the subsequent release of his body. This document contains a Bureau of Prisons incident report detailing Jeffrey Epstein's self-mutilation/suicide attempt on July 23, 2019, a detailed timeline of events surrounding his death on August 10, 2019, and related memoranda and chain of custody logs for his personal effects.
