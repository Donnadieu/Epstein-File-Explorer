    "Jeffrey Epstein (Register Number 76318-054) is listed on an inmate roster dated August 1, 2019, with an assignment code 'ATTY' (attorney) and housing unit 'Z04-206LAD'.",
    "The documents are dated August 1, 2019, which is the day after Epstein was found dead in his cell on July 31, 2019.",
    "Several inmates (Miller, Bang, Duncan, Tisdale) are noted with assignments or codes indicating 'SUICIDE OR', which likely refers to suicide observation or watch status.",
    "The documents are standard Bureau of Prisons operational forms (count sheets, out-count forms, inmate rosters) showing the routine population management at MCC New York.",
    "Epstein's listing on an 'ATTY' assignment roster suggests administrative records were still being processed or updated after his death."
