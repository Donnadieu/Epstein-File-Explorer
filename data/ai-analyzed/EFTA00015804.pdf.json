    "A key point of contention was the government's refusal to allow review of \"Sixteen DVD-R Discs from PBSO\" (Florida Item 8, Subitem 8), prompting a separate government letter explaining the denial.",
    "The evidence review required complex logistics: transporting evidence from a Bronx FBI warehouse, producing Maxwell from MDC, and using secure proffer rooms at 500 Pearl Street with restrictions on photography and electronic devices.",
    "The correspondence reveals the massive scale of evidence, including thousands of electronic images, physical items from multiple investigations, and recordings in various obsolete formats (VHS, microcassette)."
