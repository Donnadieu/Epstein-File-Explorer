    "The FBI seized a massive amount of digital evidence from Epstein's New York and U.S. Virgin Islands properties, including computers, servers, hard drives, thumb drives, SD cards, cameras, DVRs, phones, and tablets, totaling terabytes of data.",
    "Significant processing delays occurred due to staffing issues, the COVID-19 pandemic reducing office access, and technical challenges in converting forensic data into a format usable by the U.S. Attorney's Office's e-discovery tool (Relativity).",
    "The U.S. Attorney's Office experienced major problems with earlier evidence transfers, including over 1 million documents that were not searchable, had no links between emails and attachments, and had control numbers that didn't match native files, severely hampering review.",
    "The evidence was needed to support potential additional charges in the Epstein case, with prosecutors urgently seeking results from searches conducted in July and September.",
    "The correspondence reveals internal friction and miscommunication between the FBI forensic team and prosecutors regarding methodology and timelines for processing the complex digital evidence."
