    "A suicide prevention training was held at MCC New York on December 7, 2018, specifically for staff managing Special Housing Units (SHUs).",
    "The training states that 30-80% of inmate suicides in the BOP occur on locked units like SHUs, and single cells in these units are especially risky.",
    "High-risk inmate groups identified include the mentally ill, behaviorally disordered inmates, sex offenders, and protective custody inmates.",
    "The training recommends double-celling SHU inmates to reduce isolation and suicide risk, unless there is a compelling reason not to.",
    "The document references a 'Psychology Advisory List' (also called PSY Alert) to identify inmates with mental health conditions who may become dangerous or suicidal when placed in the SHU."
