  "summary": "An email from Adrian Edwards-Smith forwarded on July 12, 2019, alleging systemic abuse and cover-ups by domestic staffing agencies and wealthy clients in New York City. The author claims agencies knowingly place staff with abusive clients, including pedophiles, and use confidentiality clauses and legal threats to silence victims. The email suggests this system enabled Jeffrey Epstein and others, and calls for the US Attorney's Office to provide a safe reporting channel for domestic workers.",
