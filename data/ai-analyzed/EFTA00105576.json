    "Employee-1 will testify that multiple identical copies of this address book were kept in specific places in Epstein's Palm Beach house, a practice corroborated by a household manual (GX 606).",
    "A redacted individual ([Redacted]) possessed a copy of the same address book after leaving Epstein's employment, and was sentenced to 18 months in prison for concealing it during a grand jury investigation.",
    "The government argues the low bar for authentication is met because Employee-1 can recognize the exhibit as one of the many copies she saw, and its contents contain private information of people who knew Maxwell.",
    "The defense's forgery theory is challenged by the government, noting the book is sewn and bound, making alteration difficult, and any minor additions (like sticky notes) go to weight, not admissibility."
