    "Epstein was allowed to make a 15-minute 'social' phone call to a (347) number on a legal line, which is not recorded, despite telling staff he was calling his mother. A male answered the call.",
    "Epstein's cellmate was transferred out of MCC on the morning of August 9, 2019 (listed as WAB - With All Belongings), leaving Epstein without a cellmate, contrary to his required status. The witness states responsibility for replacing the cellmate lay with the SHU lieutenant/captain, not the unit team.",
    "The witness admits that using legal lines for inmate social calls was a common, improper practice at MCC due to staff shortages and lack of proper procedures. He later instituted corrective measures like logbooks and removing legal line access.",
    "The witness took photographs of Epstein's deceased body at the hospital with his personal phone and sent them to an Associate Warden before deleting them, citing a desire to document the body was secure.",
    "The witness speculates that the officer who found Epstein may have entered the cell alone against policy and might have caused further harm in a panicked attempt to resolve the situation, though he has no evidence of foul play."
