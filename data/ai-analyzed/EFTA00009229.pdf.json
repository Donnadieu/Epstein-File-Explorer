  "summary": "This is a transcript of an interview conducted by the DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) with R. Alexander Acosta on October 18, 2019. The interview is part of an OPR investigation into potential professional misconduct by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of Florida regarding the 2007 non-prosecution agreement (NPA) with Jeffrey Epstein and a potential violation of the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA). Acosta, the former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, is a subject of the investigation. This document is a deposition transcript of Alex Acosta, former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, being questioned about his knowledge and decision-making in the Jeffrey Epstein case. The questioning covers how the case came to the U.S. Attorney's Office, the assessment for federal prosecution, and the rationale for the non-prosecution agreement and state plea deal. Acosta discusses his interactions with staff, his views on the state attorney, and his general recollection of the case's facts. This document is a deposition transcript where a former U.S. Attorney (likely Alexander Acosta) is being questioned about the early stages of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation in 2006. The questioning focuses on the initial awareness of the case, concerns about federal jurisdiction and the 'petite policy', internal office communications, and the prosecutor's approach to pursuing the case against Epstein despite his wealth and status. This document is a deposition transcript of former U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta, being questioned about the 2006-2007 federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The questioning focuses on the internal review process within the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, communications with Epstein's defense team, and the considerations around charging Epstein. Acosta discusses his management style, the roles of his senior staff, and the legal and policy concerns that influenced the pace and direction of the investigation. This document is a deposition transcript where a former U.S. Attorney (the witness) is being questioned about the decision-making process in the Jeffrey Epstein case. The discussion focuses on charging strategies, concerns about victim credibility and legal theories, internal disagreements between federal and state prosecutors, and the influence of supervisors at the Department of Justice. The witness explains why pre-indictment resolutions were preferred in high-profile cases.",

    "The DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) is investigating whether federal prosecutors committed professional misconduct by entering into the 2007 non-prosecution agreement (NPA) with Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "OPR is also investigating Judge Marra's February 2019 finding that the government violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) by not notifying victims before the NPA.",
    "R. Alexander Acosta, as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida from 2006-2008, had ultimate authority over the Epstein case and is a subject of the OPR investigation.",
    "Acosta was recused from the Epstein case in December 2008 after notifying superiors he was seeking employment with Kirkland & Ellis, the law firm where Epstein's attorneys Ken Starr and Jay Lefkowitz worked.",
    "Acosta acknowledges the challenge of distinguishing his original recollections from information learned through subsequent publicity and litigation about the Epstein case.",
    "Acosta claims he did not know who Jeffrey Epstein was when first briefed on the case in mid-2006.",
    "The case arrived at the U.S. Attorney's Office after the state attorney had negotiated a plea deal for Epstein that required no jail time or sex offender registration.",
    "Acosta's early understanding of the case was that it involved 'a billionaire who was doing sordid things with young women or girls who were minors.'",
    "Acosta considered approaching State Attorney Barry Krischer about the case but was advised against it due to fears of leaks to Epstein.",
    "The federal investigation was known as 'Operation Leap Year' and involved over 30 victims, a fact Acosta claims he did not recall knowing at the time.",
    "The witness (likely Acosta) acknowledged a federal interest in the Epstein case due to the exploitation of minor girls and the interstate nature of the activity.",
    "Internal concerns about the 'petite policy' (federal deference to state prosecutions) were a significant factor in the office's approach to the case, though they did not halt the investigation.",
    "Prosecutor A. Marie Villafaña was described as 'hard charging' and pushed for a rapid federal indictment, sometimes communicating directly with the U.S. Attorney in an unusual breach of chain of command.",
    "The witness stated that Epstein's wealth and status did not cause concern or hesitation in pursuing the case, citing prior prosecutions of influential individuals.",
    "There was a noted disagreement or 'lively exchange' between Villafaña and another official (likely her supervisor) about the initial authorization and concerns surrounding the case.",
    "Alex Acosta states it was common practice for defense counsel to approach line prosecutors and supervisors to 'make their pitch' regarding a prosecution, and he viewed this as an appropriate part of the process.",
    "Acosta acknowledges that the submission of an 80+ page prosecution memo and 50+ page proposed indictment directly to the entire chain of command was not typical in his experience.",
    "Acosta indicates the primary concerns in the Epstein case were not the facts of the abuse (which were believed), but legal issues regarding federal jurisdiction, statute applicability, and concerns about how the victims would testify in court.",
    "The document reveals internal debate about whether the case was more appropriately a state or federal matter, a discussion that dated back to the initial meeting about the case in mid-2006.",
    "A senior prosecutor recommended charging Epstein via a criminal complaint to arrest and detain him, thereby incentivizing a pre-indictment plea deal, and suggested including conspiracy counts to make a plea 'attractive'.",
    "The witness indicates that in high-profile cases, the standard practice in the Southern District of Florida (particularly the Palm Beach office) was to negotiate pre-indictment resolutions and proceed by criminal information, not by indictment followed by dismissals.",
    "The Epstein case was considered high-profile not just due to his wealth, but because the federal government was taking over after state charges were dropped, signaling the state 'did not do enough.'",
    "There were significant concerns about victim credibility, including their youth, impressionability, fear, and potential to recant or claim Epstein 'did nothing wrong.'",
    "The witness states the relationship between federal and state authorities in this case was 'not a particularly cooperative relationship,' unlike other cases where they worked together.",
    "A supervisor in the Child Exploitation and Obscenities Section (CEOS) at DOJ provided a 'strong endorsement' of the proposed prosecution in July, but the witness claims not to have been aware of this opinion at the time."
