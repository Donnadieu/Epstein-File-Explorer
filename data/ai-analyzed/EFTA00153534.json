    "As of January 2020, investigators were actively seeking flight records for Ghislaine Maxwell from major U.S. airlines via subpoena.",
    "The subpoena request targeted two distinct time periods for Maxwell: a historical period (1994-1998) and a recent period from at least July 2019 to January 2020.",
    "The request also sought records for an unidentified individual (redacted in the source) for the periods 1994-1998 and 1995-1996, indicating a focus on a specific person's travel during the mid-1990s.",
    "The document provides detailed contact information for the legal/security departments of Delta, American, Alaska, Southwest, United, and JetBlue airlines to serve the subpoenas, showing a broad investigative approach.",
    "The email demonstrates an ongoing investigation into Maxwell's travel patterns nearly eight months after Jeffrey Epstein's arrest in July 2019."
