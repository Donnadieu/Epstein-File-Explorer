    "The FBI had approximately 40,000 images extracted from CDs seized from Epstein's New York residence, with about 3,400 initially designated as 'Highly Confidential' due to nudity.",
    "A separate FBI review of CART-processed evidence from Epstein's devices identified approximately 33,747 Highly Confidential images and 895 Highly Confidential videos, indicating a much larger volume of sensitive material than initially conveyed.",
    "The defense was granted permission to review certain Highly Confidential evidence (hard drives and boots) at an FBI field office in Colorado, but other items (photographs logged as 1A items) had to remain in New York.",
    "The prosecution defined 'Highly Confidential' material broadly as containing 'nude, partially-nude, or otherwise sexualized images, videos, or other depictions of individuals,' not limited to child pornography.",
    "There were significant technical problems with the discovery production, including corrupt files, unreadable photo formats, missing metadata, and difficulties for the defendant reviewing materials at the detention center."
