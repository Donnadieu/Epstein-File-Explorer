    "Jeffrey Epstein was sighted multiple times in late 2018 and early 2019 riding a bicycle on the Palm Beach bike path accompanied by a young girl described as Caucasian, brunette, wearing a ponytail, and not looking older than 18.",
    "The source of the sightings was afraid to contact police directly and instead reported through an intermediary to the DOJ Criminal Division.",
    "The Palm Beach Police Department had no knowledge of the incident when contacted in March 2019, despite it being the third sighting in a six-month period.",
    "The email references that registered sex offenders are not allowed on Palm Beach bike paths, accompanied or unaccompanied, and that such a sighting should constitute a police matter.",
    "The correspondence indicates video surveillance tapes on the bike path are reviewed every three months and then erased, creating potential evidence preservation issues."
