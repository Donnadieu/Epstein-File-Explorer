  "summary": "This is a letter from Ghislaine Maxwell's defense attorneys to Judge Alison J. Nathan requesting an in camera conference to discuss procedures for filing a Renewed Motion for Release on Bail under seal. The letter argues that the motion contains sensitive private information about sureties, financial records, and confidential discovery materials that should be protected from public disclosure due to privacy concerns and documented threats. The government consents to some redactions but not to the conference. Judge Nathan's endorsement orders Maxwell to justify why the letter itself should be sealed.",
