    "This document is a service request log for technical work at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York, where Jeffrey Epstein was held.",
    "The request is for the installation and programming of a new 'Nice Vision' surveillance system, involving 4 SVRs, 1 decoder, 12 encoders, and approximately 161 cameras.",
    "The work was scheduled for August 12-16, 2019, with a specific log entry made on August 15, 2019.",
    "The document indicates approximately 20 cameras were non-operational ('out') at the time of the log.",
    "The context suggests this could relate to maintenance or upgrades of the facility's security infrastructure around the time of Epstein's incarceration."
