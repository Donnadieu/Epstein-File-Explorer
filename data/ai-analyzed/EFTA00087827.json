It details a manual review of three BOP-issued Samsung Galaxy S9 phones belonging to correctional officers at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. The review was conducted to determine if the devices contained any unauthorized communications related to the suicide of Jeffrey Epstein on August 10, 2019.
