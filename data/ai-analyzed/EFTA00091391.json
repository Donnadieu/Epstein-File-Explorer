    "Data was seized from multiple electronic devices at Jeffrey Epstein's properties in New York and the Virgin Islands, but a privilege review by Epstein's estate has prevented the prosecution and defense from accessing materials deemed privileged.",
    "The government states that none of the seized electronic devices belonged to Ghislaine Maxwell, which legally restricts the prosecution team from providing the full set of non-privileged extracted data to the defense.",
    "The government anticipates producing only materials responsive to the search warrants for the seized devices by November 9, 2020, and the prosecution team will also only have access to that responsive set."
