  "summary": "This is the U.S. Government's legal response to a victim's emergency petition seeking enforcement of rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) in the Jeffrey Epstein case. The government argues that no federal 'court proceeding' exists to trigger certain CVRA rights because Epstein was only charged in state court, and defends its decision to negotiate a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein's attorneys without prior victim consultation, citing concerns about witness impeachment and the need for confidentiality.",

    "The U.S. Government argues that the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) does not grant the petitioner a right to be consulted before the Government entered into a non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein, as no federal criminal proceeding had been initiated.",
    "A key condition of the non-prosecution agreement was that victims would retain the right to sue Epstein under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 for civil damages as if he had been federally convicted.",
    "The Government defended its confidentiality during negotiations, citing concerns that disclosure could allow Epstein to impeach victim witnesses if a deal fell through and a federal prosecution proceeded.",
    "Victim notification letters were hand-delivered by FBI agents and an AUSA during the investigation, and victim counsel Brad Edwards was notified of the state plea hearing on June 27, 2008.",
    "The document reveals that Epstein's attorneys argued victims were motivated by financial gain, which the Government considered a potential impeachment issue."
