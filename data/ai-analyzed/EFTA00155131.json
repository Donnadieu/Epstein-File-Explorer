    "The email chain shows ongoing coordination in July 2021 between the FBI, NYPD, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York on evidence and witness tasks for the Ghislaine Maxwell case.",
    "Specific tasks include obtaining .avi files from CART (likely computer analysis), reviewing images for photos of a specific individual, and identifying Palm Beach Police Department witnesses to authenticate evidence seized from Jeffrey Epstein's residence.",
    "The document references interviews of a witness conducted on January 20 and 21, 2021, for which draft FBI 302 reports were requested.",
    "Several Palm Beach Police Department officers are listed as potential witnesses for authenticating evidence seized from Epstein's home, including those who searched specific rooms and handled electronic devices.",
    "The correspondence indicates that evidence processing was delayed, partly due to the CART unit being occupied with the Capitol investigation."
