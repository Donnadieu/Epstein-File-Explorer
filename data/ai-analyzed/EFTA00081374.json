    "A massive document collection effort was undertaken, covering hundreds of thousands of emails from SDFL and FBI holdings, including emails from key individuals like Alex Acosta and his staff.",

    "Despite being a formally captioned subject in the FBI's SDFL case as of December 2, 2006, Ghislaine Maxwell's name did not appear in any reviewed documents or emails, and she was not addressed in the prosecution memo supporting Epstein's indictment.",
    "The DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) was in the final stages of its report on the Epstein matter, with a draft expected within a week and a public release anticipated for August 2020.",
    "The document collection included a notorious \"one-sided email\" made public in CVRA litigation, which involved defense counsel communications that were redacted when released."
