    "Procedural failures are highlighted, such as staff not following up on emails expressing concern for Epstein's mental state, not properly acting on a US Marshals suicide alert notice upon his return from court, and failing to maintain direct observation during his attorney visits while on suicide watch.",
    "The institution's response outlines corrective actions, including eliminating Psychological Observation status, enhancing PSY ALERT procedures, increasing training, and improving accountability for inmate assignments and logbook documentation.",
    "The document establishes that PSY ALERT status is to be applied more frequently to high-profile cases and inmates with a history or charge of a sex offense, like Epstein, to ensure continuity of care during movements and transitions."
